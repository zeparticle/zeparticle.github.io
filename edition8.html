            <h3>By Bhargavi</h3>
            <p>Thank you all so much for voting last edition!
                <br><br> A majority of the votes were for B, so our character is going to pick up the key and keep it
                while
                searching for more clues.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <hr>
            <p>I decide to test my fate, and I pick up the key. If worse comes to worst, I know I have at least one ally
                for
                me behind the four doors that wait to be opened. That is, hoping the note isn’t lying…
                <br><br>
                Besides, who even wrote it? I see no one here, not even a pen that someone may have used to write it. I
                guess it must have been something supernatural, like everything else here. This whole scenario is so
                weird.
                Why am I the one here?
                <br><br>

                I walk right back down the path where I came from. I pass the fire-lit torches again, but somehow it
                feels
                like a longer walk than the first time. I walk faster, but the stairway is not even in sight. I run,
                slowly
                at first but faster by the second. The stairway is missing. It goes missing as randomly as it appeared.
                <br><br>

                Great. I was trapped in a strange house, and now I’m trapped in the strange house’s basement. Trying to
                catch my breath, I accidentally drop the key. I barely blink, and the stairs are back in front of me. I
                almost run up them, but I realise that I forgot the key and turn to go fetch it. The second I turn back
                around, the stairway ceases to exist. What kind of magic is this? I drop the key again, because I have a
                theory in my mind. I close my eyes, key on the floor. If I’m right, as soon as I open my eyes the
                stairway
                should appear. Not surprisingly, it seems that I was right. It’s some kind of sick game this house is
                playing on me.
                <br><br>

                I can’t take the stairs if I’m in contact with the key.
                <br><br>

                Going upstairs without the key would be utterly useless; I’d just go back to looking around the place
                pointlessly. If I stayed here, however, that just seems stupider. There’s nothing I can do here. With my
                luck, I bet the stone wall is back at the end of the passage.
                <br><br>

                Oh! I have an idea!
                <br><br>

                The only thing I can’t do is have direct contact with the key, right? Simple enough. Thank you, fashion
                designers for having added pockets in everyday clothes. I pick up the key and slip it into my back
                pocket. I
                close my eyes, and sure enough, when I open them again, there the stairway is. All I have to do now is
                walk
                upstairs and get out of this weird dingy, dark place.
                <br><br>

                The second I take my foot off the last stair, the stairway vanishes into thin air for the umpteenth
                time.
                I’m a little less surprised this time than all the times before. Am I… getting used to this place? No, I
                won’t let that happen.
                <br><br>

                I’ve thought over my choices. Opening any of the doors will be way too risky; no way will I give up my
                safety in the hope for an ally. In all reality, (well, as real as it gets in this place.) there’s no
                danger
                I am in, in this moment. There aren’t any freaky monsters chasing me, no flood coming my way, no raging
                flames in the next room. I’m as safe as I can be in this second.
                <br><br>

                I’m going to keep the key with me, in case I’ll need it in the near future. I don’t trust my luck nearly
                enough to choose a door at random. Who knows what the hell is behind them?
                <br><br>

                I pocket the key again and keep walking. As a result of mindless footsteps, I see the floor is covered
                in
                footprint-shaped dust prints. It takes me a minute to even realise that those were mine. Stressed, I end
                up
                walking back to the kitchen. I see the stove is still on. I wonder if there’s something I can cook or
                eat.
                On finding a few slices of expired bread, I eat them quickly, forgetting my earlier plans of toasting
                them
                over the flame. I’m about to open the fridge again, when I remember the stench that wafted out the first
                time I opened it. Rotten food or something. I don’t have the best sense of smell; I can’t pinpoint
                exactly
                what it reeks of.
                <br><br>

                I’m still sitting where I was, on the kitchen counter. For the first time, I take in the way the house
                actually looks. Lacking a front door is probably the only thing architecturally wrong with this place.
                It
                looks like it’s got completed sets of designer furniture, and even the plates I found on the shelves
                seem to
                be extremely high quality ceramic. Hell, even the wallpaper looks expensive. Whoever created this place
                sure
                spent truckloads of money. Or maybe it’s all weird magic and paranormal things. The house doesn’t look
                too
                old… I could even say it looks freshly set up.
                <br><br>

                Was this place created… just for me?
                <br><br>

                No, certainly not. I have incredibly self-absorbed thoughts at times.
                <br><br>

                Wait, what about the stove? Didn’t that have some keyhole last time I checked? I wonder if this key
                would
                fit there.
                <br><br>

                I hop off the counter and take slow steps toward the stove. It’s still on, though I’m sure it’s been a
                while
                since it would’ve been turned on. Didn’t the gas for this thing ever run out? Anyway, I crouch slightly
                to
                take a better look at the keyhole in the stove. It’s extremely strange, to have a keyhole in a random
                spot
                like that, isn’t it? Set right between the two handles, it’s almost like it’s inviting me to put the key
                in.
                Would the key even fit here though?
                <br><br>

                Drowning in curiosity, I shove the key into the hole in the stove, hoping that it will put out the flame
                and
                I’ll find a clue or something. I’ll take anything at this point.
                <br><br>

                The flames of the stove disappear for a split second, and then engulf the entire machine. It’s so sudden
                that I forgot to even take my hand out the fire, and I have small burns now.
                <br><br>

                It’s not stopping… the flames are spreading to the counter!
                <br><br>

                Ah, this is what the note meant, didn’t it? The fire was my ally when it lit up the pathway for me… and
                now
                it’s going to kill me. How cruel, yet genius.
                <br><br>

                Luckily, I see a sink with what looks like a running water supply… maybe I can put out the fire. What do
                I
                do?
                <br><br>

                <hr>
                <br><br>
            <p>
                This is where you, the reader, come in. What do you think our character should do? Please choose one
                letter
                and one number of the options below.
                <br><br>

                <strong>A)</strong> Let the fire engulf the kitchen, and leave. It’s one less place to worry about
                finding
                more strange things. This will also eradicate the horrid smell from the fridge. Plus, the kitchen has a
                weird door, which seems fireproof. The fire, with luck, will stay inside the kitchen.
                <br><br>

                <strong>B) </strong>Try to douse the flame. You still haven’t found out what’s in the fridge… it could
                be a
                clue in the most unlikely place, just like you got a clue from a stone wall.
                <br><br>
                <strong>1)</strong> Leave the key in the stove, then option a. It’ll probably be of no use in the
                future.
                <br><br>
                <strong>2) </strong>Get the key. You never know if you’ll need it again.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            </p>

                Chronicles of Joy: chapter 5
            </h1>
            <h3>By Sriram</h3>
            <p>It didn’t go as it was planned. Enter Alatar the Blue and Strength. As we were nearing Yukon, we met
                rivals
                in air. The guys were tough. Strength was, like, invulnerable. What’s more was that the girl could make
                us
                do stuff by just, you know, persuading us through our minds. Moral would turn to fight her and run away
                screaming. She’d read our minds, and just as I’d block a backhand she’d pull my sword away.
                <br><br>
                And Alatar- the guy had mad power. He manipulated time. Like, there was this one time where I swung at
                him.
                Calm. He clicked a finger on his staff and just like that- everyone stopped moving, but we could see. He
                skipped away, shrieking, ‘Tra-La-La! I can’t hear you!’ And every time Alatar lost focus and got
                wounded,
                Strength would rejuvenate him. We barely managed to escape them. And even that was not because of our
                bravery or anything- It was because when I cut of the head of Alatar, Moral kept Strength busy enough
                (By
                pouring pepper in her eyes) to ensure that Alatar died.
                <br><br>
                He didn’t die.
                <br><br>
                At the last second, Moral let go of Strength (‘Cause that girl was strong) and we all ran for our lives.
                They escaped, and we all lived happily ever after for about twenty minutes.
                <br><br>
                Then came Atheris, Mistress of Snakes. If she had wanted to, she could have killed us and lived happily
                ever
                after. But nope. She didn’t, which was a surprise. She turned us away when we asked for supplies. When
                we
                hung around planning in her yard, she sent me a message.
                <br><br>


                <i>Wot y’al dooing in moi yard!? That one eench of spes u r standeeng
                    on eez maine! </i>
                <br><br>


                Surprise, surprise, we decided to leave. Then, we had to deal with Rebel. That girl was tough prey. I
                was
                like, When do we get easy prey? The girl did nothing by the usual way. She was left-handed with her
                sword.
                She kept her hair in two space buns. She wore her shirt backwards to front. In short, she was like a
                teen
                rebel, and her nature suited her name perfectly. Which also meant trouble for us. The usual ways of
                maiming,
                killing, torturing and dismembering did not work with her. Every time she dodged our swipes at her, she
                said, ‘Punks. You guys wouldn’t know Fight if she hit you in the face.’
                <br><br>


                Yeah, she wasn’t exactly the ‘Barbie and Ponies and Rainbows’ girl. More like the ‘Fight and Fight and
                Fight’ girl. We had a hard, hard time getting away from her. Slumping our way to Chaos’ place, we
                figured
                that we’d all rest a couple of days and take Chaos to help us fight Evil.

                How can this person make you cry in pain at one moment and make you laugh with tears of joy, the very
                next
                moment?

            <h3>By Varsha</h3>
            <p>
                <i>We can do this.
                    <br><br>
                    Together.
                    <br><br>

                    Right?
                    <br><br>

                    No second guessing ourselves.
                    <br><br>

                    No looking back- as soon as we take off, that’s that.
                    <br><br>

                    Yes. </i>
                <br><br>

                I sigh.
                <br><br>

                It’s been a year- or maybe more; I can’t really remember, all I’m really left with is a hazy memory of
                loss
                and pain. I guess I'm lucky then. In a way. <br><br>

                I don’t really have to remember and relive what happened in the past. An amnesiac, yes. I can’t really
                recall old memories- or new ones either. <br><br>

                I do however remember pieces and fragments- shards of my broken past, but they have no context, and I
                choose
                to ignore them. Trust me, it’s better that way. <br><br>

                I get up every day, and I’m hit with a wave of unfamiliarity- I could go as far as to say it’s become a
                habit. <br><br>

                I breathe in. On top of the trauma of having to relearn everything all over again, I gain a new memory
                every
                day. <br><br>

                And the thing that makes it harder for me to sleep at night, is that each memory is completely
                different. No
                ties, no connections, no proof to be sure that these are my memories. They feel more like snippets from
                nightmares, with unnecessary details, skipping important parts. I recall the eyes of a cat piercing me.
                <br><br>

                I remember the smell of the sea- fresh, saline water; it feels as if I were just there- a touch away.
                <br><br>

                I remember hiding, my tiny frame scrunched into a cupboard, not excited, but scared. <br><br>

                None of it makes sense. I have no proof that these are even my memories. But every day, I have to brave
                through the voices in my head. <br><br>

                Because no else will. It’s just me, and my fear. Alone. <br><br>

                Everything weighs down on my hope. <br><br>

                Hope that one day, one day, I’ll remember more than just segments. <br><br>


                I know that one fateful day, I’ll remember who I really am. <br><br>


                <hr>
            <p>

                Every morning, a soft but persuasive voice tells me to just stop.
                <br><br>

                Not to try. And I wish I could listen. <br><br>

                Wish I could give up. <br><br>

                But I know I never will. <br><br>

                I still have the thirst to rediscover, and it drives me. <br><br>

                So I move on. <br><br>

                My dog gets me up in the morning- just like how it’s always been. <br><br>

                He jumps on my bed and licks my face, radiating euphoria and I simply can’t help but break into a smile.
                He
                means everything to me. And I know I’ll never leave his side. <br><br>

                Oddly enough, he’s the only one I remember when I wake up. So he’s the only one I’ve trusted; the only
                one I
                ever will trust. <br><br>

                I gently run my hand through his bright mauve coat as he waits for me to slip his leash on for a walk.
                <br><br>

                I get up, my feet shaking and stumble towards the sink. <br><br>

                And then I remember. <br><br>

                A new memory, and it’s nothing like the ones before. <br><br>

                Because this time I feel something I’ve never felt before. <br><br>

                Fear so intense that it leaves me trembling, gasping for air. <br><br>
                Because this time, I remember running from the inevitable darkness, and I don’t remember coming back.

            <h3>By Paddy</h3>
            <p>Sponges are really dirty yet we use them to clean the things we eat on. I mean, think about it. A bunch
                of
                pores with water and dirt in them and very hard to clean all of it out.
                <br><br>
                Now that I think about it, all of the dirt in the world is still there, somewhere. We have to make
                something
                dirty to clean something else. Where does dust even come from.
                <br><br>
                Like I said, all of the garbage is still out there, but all of the garbage was still technically there a
                100
                years ago, or the beginning of Earth. Or the beginning of the Universe, the fact that everything used to
                be
                in one small atom still scares me. I mean, there are many atoms right now, what if they start to
                explode, or
                maybe they already did and there are millions of little universes we can’t see, maybe those universes
                are
                what we call atoms. What if we were just a tiny speck to someone, or something else in another
                dimension?
                <br><br>
                Does anyone else randomly think that they aren’t the protagonist of their life. Or, what if we were just
                play things someone made for them to watch and be amused, what if I’m just an extra and can be replaced.
                Well that got dark quickly.
                <br><br>
                So like. People say ‘ur’ as a short form for your while texting. But what about ‘you’re’? Why does no
                one
                say u’r? English is confusing.
                <br><br>
                Toothbrushes. Why’re they even called that if they brush more than one tooth- Teethbrush. Ok no that
                just
                sounds weird.
                <br><br>
                What if birds had arms lol
                <br><br>
                I don’t think people ever notice until someone points it out or they have a brain wave for random things
                like how breakfast is basically breaking the fast, which was when you were asleep. It’s right there but
                you
                don’t notice it until you do- I’m sure there are a bunch of other thing like this, if you know them,
                enlighten me with the sacred knowledge.
                <br><br>
                Flutes are basically over glorified whistles that make a bunch of squeaky noises-
                <br><br>
                Cement factories. I find them quite interesting, they make something that they’re built up of. And the
                building of one would be quite an interesting thing to watch- same thing with brick factories.
                <br><br>
                How do fish end up in ponds lol it’s not like they were already there and it’s not like humans put them
                in-
                like it doesn’t rain fish right? Ok never mind I looked it up and apparently there have been instances
                where
                it has rained fish. Well that was good to know.
                <br><br>
                You know how babies are born with 300 something bones? And then they all merge to make 206 of them. This
                is
                weird to think about but bones will be there with you throughout your entire life, almost all organs
                come to
                think of it. Organs man, they’re such good friends.
                <br><br>
                Air and water is basically the same as a 100 years ago. I could be breathing the air a dinosaur did 0.o
                <br><br>
                What if humans evolved like butterflies through metamorphosis, how would their cycle be like? And can we
                talk about over exaggerated nature documentaries for a second? The background music and how the narrator
                describes the animals is just so funny- But what would a documentary about humans look like? And more
                importantly, who would film it? 0.o
                <br><br>
                How long would my nails and hair be if I never cut it- kind of disgusting-
                <br><br>
                Our brain is basically an electrified hunk of flesh.

                Horses
            </h1>
            <h3>By Aadhav</h3>
            <p><strong>Abstract Art </strong><br>Abstract art or non-objective art is the form of art where the
                paintings
                portray everything but what is captured by the natural eye, or rather what is seen in the natural world.
                Abstract art is art that does not attempt to represent an accurate depiction of a visual reality but
                instead
                use shapes, colours, forms and gestural marks to achieve its effect. Abstract art can be ‘abstract’ in
                many
                ways; by colour, shape, size, or even the texture and tone. Prior to the 20th century this abstract art
                was
                to portray human civilization rather than the artist's feelings. <br><br>
                Abstract art originated sometime in the 19th century and it was greatly based on the movement
                romanticism.
                This new style of painting allowed the painters to paint with freedom and expression. Though it can be
                very
                confusing to view abstract art, it is a movement that was the base and foundation for other movements
                like
                cubism. Abstract art is like a puzzle itself, trapped in it is the artist's true meaning for the
                painting.
                <br>
                <br> Example - ‘Senecio’ - Paul Klee:
                <br>
                <img src="edition-8/abstractart.jpg" style="border-radius: 5%; width:30%;">
                <br><br>
                <strong>Cubism </strong> <br>
                Cubism is a form of art that uses several objects, for the painting and in the painting captured from
                different dimensions and angles. Cubism is the base for craft styles like collages because artists like
                Picasso and Jackson Pollock used bits of paper, music sheets, cigarette ash and broken utensils in their
                paintings. Most cubist works are actually extremely deceiving, because you tend to see a normal
                household in
                most paintings, and the paintings are viewed by you from the artist's perspective. That is, you are
                viewing
                it from a different angle than the usual position of these objects. Cubist painters were not bound to
                copying form, texture, colour, and space. Instead, they presented a new reality in paintings that
                depicted
                radically fragmented objects.
                <br> <br>
                Example - Still life with chair caning - Picasso:
                <br>
                <img src="edition-8/cubism.jpg" style="border-radius: 5%; width:30%;"> <br><br>
                <strong>Surrealism </strong>
                <br>
                Surrealism, movement in visual art and literature, flourishing in Europe between World Wars I and II.
                Surrealism grew principally out of the earlier Dada movement. The movement represented a reaction
                against
                what its members saw as the destruction wrought by the “rationalism” that had guided European culture
                and
                politics in the past and that had culminated in the horrors of World War I.
                Surrealism was a means of reuniting conscious and unconscious realms of experience so completely that
                the
                world of dream and fantasy would be joined to the everyday rational world in “an absolute reality, a
                surreality.” The work of major Surrealist painters is too diverse to be summarized categorically.
                Each artist sought his or her own means of self-exploration. With its emphasis on content and free form,
                Surrealism provided a major alternative to the contemporary, highly formalistic Cubist movement and was
                largely responsible for perpetuating in modern painting the traditional emphasis on content.
                Though it was a movement dominated by men—there were several talented women in this movement. <br>
                <br> Example - Harlequin’s Carnival - Joan Miro:
                <br>
