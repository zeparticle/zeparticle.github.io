            <h1>Chronicles of joy - Chapter 3:Luck! No!
            </h1>
            <h3>By Sriram</h3>
            <p>

                We came back feeling sick. ‘Now that you know you’re Joy, I can help you transform into a god. Give me
                your hand.’
                <br><br>
                I suddenly grew into the same height as my sister. All of a sudden, I smelt flowers, home, joy and
                everything related to me. ‘That’s the burden of our god form,’ Luck said. ‘We have to resist the call of
                The Shimmer. It finds our weak spots and attacks them, beckoning us to it. Your weakest spots are Joy
                and home, because you’re attached to those in many ways. My weakest spots are Luck and Moral,
                because I’m attached to dad in many ways.’
                <br><br>
                I loved being a god so much, I barely heard her. Extraordinary power. The big cheese. ‘No, you’re not
                the
                big cheese. Yes, I can read your mind. Gods can read other people’s minds. Try reaching into my mind
                now.’
                <br><br>
                She was thinking about her husband, Fortune. I told her that. ‘Yeah. I’m worried about him. Without his
                prophecies, he’ll have nothing to do. If we gods get bored, we’re so hyper to do something that we get
                bored of getting bored. And when that happens, we can literally combust.’
                <br><br>
                ‘Oh.’
                <br><br>
                ‘Now, get out. We’ve landed.’
                <br><br>
                I got out to find that we were in a place different from Melbourne. With large, high-raise buildings and
                beautiful trees, it looked magnificent. ‘Welcome to the Big Apple, brother.’
                <br><br>
                ‘Why are we here?’

                <br><br>
                ‘This,’ she said, ‘was the last place our dear grandmother was seen.’
                <br><br>
                Our grandmother. The idea of Evil becoming grandmother to me sounded absurd. ‘Let’s go.’
                <br><br>
                ‘To where? “Oh, Mr. Shopkeeper, have you seen my grandmother, who is Evil and is hastening to bring
                Doomsday up and about?”’
                <br><br>
                ‘Very funny. We’re going to Evil’s house.’
                <br><br>
                ‘What?’
                <br><br>
                ‘We have to set her up with a bait, Joy. She’ll know it’s her killer under a camouflage, and she’ll
                hasten
                to kill you- upon which I’ll kill her.’
                <br><br>
                I’d like to say everything went fine. You’d figure we delayed Doomsday and went to play PlayStations
                happily for once. But nope. We went. Up till the ‘bait’ part everything worked fine. Right when Luck
                manifested to kill her, Evil sensed another presence and swung her sword in a deadly arc, decapitating
                Luck. <br><br>
                ‘No!’<br><br>
                I collapsed in a pile of tears. Battling my way to the door, I barely escaped. And here I was,
                trudging along towards number 12, Battalion Street, Melbourne. I figured that my sister, being
                immortal, would manifest again. But the power of Evil’s sword… I didn’t know if I’d see her again. On my
                way back, I attracted some stares, being the ten-feet-tall monster I was. I wanted to pummel my Mom
                and Dad for not telling me sooner, not coming to my aid.<br><br>

                Grief and tiredness overwhelmed me, and I
                collapsed in the sand.

            <h1>
                Is nobody correct?
            </h1>
            <h3>Anonymous</h3>
            <p>The lights switched on for the very first time; we became both the object and creator of our worldview.
                Our
                view of the world and the understanding of everything is formulated by our consciousness in a reflexive
                continual feedback loop.
                <br><br>
                So, the world exists behind a sheathe of non-objectivism -- this doesn't mean that the physical world is
                a
                mere extension of the mind or it doesn't exist outside of consciousness but rather, the world we
                experience
                does not. We can’t see things as they are because we are compelled by a necessity of nature to see
                things as
                we are, and are forever constricted to the system of perception our mind allows-- which is known as the
                egocentric predicament. If you and I look at the leaves of a tree, we might both say that they are
                “green.”
                Although we may both agree we are seeing green we are actually seeing the qualia of what we call green.
                But
                could it be that you see them as green, while I see them as a colour closer to your brown, or possibly
                even
                your purple. For a colour-blind individual would they really be wrong if they said the colour they see
                isn't
                green and if they did agree they would do so only out of a sense of willingness to sacrifice the truth
                of
                what they see to what the majority of the people see. What if the leaves were in reality a different
                colour
                that humans can't even comprehend let alone perceive?
                <br><br>
                Wouldn’t we all be just as correct or incorrect as the colour-blind individual who claims it isn't? What
                if
                all of a sudden we could identify colours in a different wavelength of light? We would agree that the
                leaves
                we see are not green, and the people who say it is are incorrect when the leaves in themselves never
                changed. If all human 'truths' are of agreements on shared subjective experiences which are all limited
                by
                human perception, and we build all ideas on an unstable foundation constantly changing we would never
                know
                if we could ever be able to reach objective truth or if it even exists. Maybe all the above mentioned
                ideas
                are completely wrong and contradict everything you believe to be true but ironically that supports the
                main
                point here. Perhaps we should just accept all subjective truths often enough and embrace often being
                wrong.

                <strong>WHO DID IT?</strong><br>
                (based on an idea by Tinkle Digest)
                <br><br>
                “Mr Patel, thank you for coming here this evening. I have a problem I want to discuss with you.”
                <br><br>
                “Sure, Mrs. Lakshmi. What is it?”
                <br><br>

                “So I was teaching the class. I gave each student a few pictures, and they had to write captions under
                each,
                with a maximum of 20 characters. I went out of the classroom as another teacher called me, and I came
                back
                to the classroom, to find my precious globe, worth more than ten thousand rupees, smashed to the ground!
                <br><br>
                None of the students admitted to the mischief, or give any hint to who did it.”
                <br><br>
                “May I see the captions?”
                <br><br>
                “Sure. Here they are.”
                <br><br>
                “Hmm. Only one student’s work is odd, with very short captions.”
                <br><br>
                Indeed it was. Under a picture of a hot day, Prakriti had written “Noon”, under a picture of a bad math
                exam
                paper she had written “Repaper” and under a picture of a teacher teaching a class she had written
                “Ma’am”.
                <br><br>
                “Do you think it is her, Mrs. Lakshmi? She might have written short captions so she could finish faster
                and
                do the mischief.”
                <br><br>
                “I think not, Mr. Patel. She is one of the best in my class, in both terms of the subject and
                behaviour.”
                <br><br>
                “Hmm. Can I see a list of the students’ names then?”
                <br><br>
                “Sure.”
                <br><br>
                The list had the following names: Aditya, Anjali, Bharat, Dinesh, Gayathri, Harshita, Kanak, Mohan,
                Prakriti, Rajesh, Tara, Tarun and Yogesh.
                <br><br>
                “I got the perpetrator’s name!” said Mr. Patel.
                <br><br>

            <p>
                Chilli is considered to be hot but if you take the last ‘I’ away from it it's chill which the opposite
                of
                hot. That made no sense at all whatsoever.
                <br><br>
                So one day, I pressed this little button at the side of the fridge door and apparently fridge lights
                turn
                off. Was I supposed to know that-

                <br><br>

                Dreams are basically custom made movies for you and your handwriting is a custom made font.
                <br><br>

                Dogs pee loudly to show dominance, humans in public bathrooms pee as quite as possible because we’re all
                shy
                to let other people we pee. Just an observation-
                <br><br>

                Galileo sounds like Lil Leo said “gah”. That's the dumbest thing I've thought of today, yet it makes so
                much
                sense in my head.
                <br><br>
                Water on Earth was originally ice from rocks that smashed into Earth, so the entire time, we’ve been
                using
                the same water. And if you think about it, we never buy water, we only pay rent to borrow it.
                <br><br>

                We never get hotter or colder we’re just giving or taking heat. Just like energy, the amount of energy
                in
                the universe never changes, it just transforms into different types.
                <br><br>

                If every job needed experience, soon, we would all be jobless.
                <br><br>
                Every time I look back about 2 years I always question if I even had a brain then- just me?
                <br><br>
                Take a moment to appreciate everything’s unique tastes, scents, view, feel and sound. Even the so called
                “tasteless” things in life. Like water, it has a taste, I can tell purified water apart from toilet
                water-
                what I mean to say is everything has a taste. Some things that we don’t notice too, like we always have
                the
                taste of saliva in our mouth to the point where we don’t really notice its taste.
                <br><br>
                Once had a person ask me “Oh, you like pi? Name every digit.” I have weird friends.
                <br><br>
                What happens to poison when it expires? Does it get more poisonous or does it lose its potency?
                <br><br>
                Textbook sentences are complicated. As in they use big words in every sentence, what even is the point
                of
                that. What is the point of synonyms? Just to sound fancier? Why say 'Fascinating' when you can say 'Very
                interesting'? Just use words everyone can understand, if we all did that, we could save so much time.
                <br><br>

                There’s a dog hair on my keyboard right now. That was random. plot twist I don’t have a dog Speaking of
                dogs
                apparently their body temperature is a little higher than ours. That wasn't even the point of what I was
                going to say- If you have a pet cat or dog or fish or snake, idk what pets you have. But almost all of
                them
                live far lesser than humans unless you have a turtle I guess, and that's sad. Go give them a hug.
                <br><br>
                So one of my friends pointed out that 'oK' looks like a stick man when you tilt your head to the left,
                at
                first I didn’t notice it but now I can’t un-see it and I randomly think of it every once in a while so I
                have to put it in here. Now you have it stuck in your head too, you're welcome.
                <br><br>
                Santa and Satan have the same words but switched around. Evil and live, devil and lived too. Enjoy that
                information.

            <h1>Earworms</h1>
            <h3>By Varsha</h3>
            <p>
                So you listened to that one favourite song of yours.
                Or was it the playlist that always made you feel better? Maybe you caught a glimpse of the name of that
                obscure song whose name you couldn’t remember no matter how you tried.
                But ultimately, it all ended with you stuck with a tune in your head for the rest of the day.
                And no matter what you tried to do, you couldn’t get it out.

                <br><br>
                Music has become more or less an integral part of our lives, something that often defines us.
                And the more we listen, the more we’re used to the feeling of a song stuck in our heads.
                And science can answer that, with one single word- earworms.
                Now, don’t panic. Earworms aren’t literally worms, but instead phrases, songs or tunes, stuck in the
                back of
                our heads.

                <br><br>
                In normal cases, these earworms last for a day- a mere 24 hours.
                They are mostly neutral, and in some cases, even pleasing to hear. They aren’t generally considered
                dangerous.
                This happens when our brains are stressed out, and it sticks to a particular thought or idea that seems
                to
                repeat itself. This is how an earworm occurs.
                However, scientists believe that chewing on a stick of gum for four minutes can drive earworms out.
                Astoundingly, 98% of people in the world have experienced earworms at least once in their life.
                Music is incredibly influential over people, and is scientifically proven that it has a positive effect
                over
                depression.
                And earworms are one of the odd wonders that music can stimulate.

                “Of course! Don’t you know people are supposed to laugh when a joke is told?”
                <br><br>
                “She isn’t joking, doofus. I waited for years, and all I get is this?” Said Amber, to Reylia.
                <br><br>
                “Amber is right.” Said Arbeal. “We indeed are in the Sun’s core.
                <br><br>
                “But how come we haven’t died from the heat yet?” I said.
                <br><br>
                “Ah, the history of The Second Earth.” Said Amethius.
                <br><br>
                “The Second Earth?” Said Leo and I, in unison.
                <br><br>
                “It goes like this…” said Amethius.
                <br><br>
                “Our base was originally on Earth. But then our borders were crossed by somebody once. Thankfully that
                person left before finding about us. This, by the way, happened millennia ago. So, then we created
                another
                base secretly, far from the planets. We figured a way to teleport ourself to the exact middle of the
                Sun,
                with a force field made by Arbeal, which protected us. I then summoned a few servant spirits, and made
                raw
                materials. You will learn more about this later. Arbeal then turned these materials into proper
                materials,
                Reylia manipulated the servants into helping us and they first built the cave where you first met us. As
                years passed, the force field grew, and more rooms and places were made by us. Now the Second Earth has
                reached its peak, and outside the door, you see grasslands, hills and many other places made with the
                same
                elements as Earth. Hence the name.”
                <br><br>
                “Whoa! How did you three manage to do it?” I said, still astonished by the fact that outside this place,
                it
                was fiery and 15 million degrees outside. “And what’s the deal with the jelly-wall room?” said Leo, who
                had
                surprisingly kept quiet the whole time.
                <br><br>
                “To answer your question, Duncan, it’s a safety room, where we go if we are attacked and defenceless.
                These
                “jelly walls” actually provide more protection than you think. And for yours, Rodriguez, like I said, we
                were blessed with powers. Arbeal can control the Elements on a much larger scale than the other wizards
                can.
                I can create all of nature’s plants and even more I never knew existed. Reylia has immense strength, can
                even lend strength to others, and also if she concentrates enough, can will objects to do anything.”
                <br><br>
                “Wow! Why would you even need defence systems then?”
                <br><br>
                “Because most enemies are not as easy to defeat as you think!”
                <br><br>
                “True. I’ve seen most of them, so you two idiots better not go near them. Got it, little babies?” Said
                Amber
                in a baby voice, who was getting irritating.
                <br><br>
                “Shut up. Anyway, can we go out and explore yet, Arbeal?” Said Leo.
                <br><br>
                “Sure. Here, take this map.”
                <br><br>
                “Ew, who still uses maps?”
                <br><br>
                “So you want to get lost- “
                <br><br>
                “Fine, fine, we’ll take it.”
                <br><br>
                The map had the Base in the middle, surrounded by grasslands and small hills (very small, you can climb
                them
                in a few minutes), and Lake Calm at one side, with a forest at the side opposite to our base. We were
                told
                not to go into the forest, as it had monsters for training, and we hadn’t begun it yet. Here and there,
                there were small shelters scattered around the area, for emergencies. I counted 6, labelled A through F.
                <br><br>
                We went outside the door.
                <br><br>
                It was simply stunning, beautiful, mysterious and like a movie all at the same time.
                <br><br>
                We went around the small hills, which had many beautiful flower bushes growing on them. It looked like
                the
                first stage of sunset, the sky having both blue and pink colours, with no sun (obviously, we were IN
                it).
                After some time, we went back to the Base, and it was time to begin our training.
                <br><br>
                We all had to go to separate rooms for our learning.
                <br><br>
                Arbeal told me all about the Four Elements: They were Fire, Ice, Wind, and Electricity. Amber had a long
                backstory she told us, and Leo had an eventful day of learning too.

            <h1>The Firefly</h1>
            <h3>By Pranith</h3>
            <p>
                There was once a normal fly flying through the darkness of the sky.
                <br><br>
                It needed some warmth and light and was looking for a source. It then came upon a group of campers who
                were
                all seated around a fire. The fly saw the relaxed and happy faces of the campers and wanted to
                experience
                this strange feeling.
                <br><br>
                It then tried to touch the fire with his wings but it kept getting singed. So it tried to touch the
                roaring
                flames with its backside. It suddenly felt a feeling but it was not happiness. It was agony!
                <br><br>
                The fly shot into the sky, took some deep breaths and looked at his back. But what a wonder of wonders!
                The
                back was emitting light and the fly’s chillness had also gone. The fly happily zipped off into the night
                and
                this was how the first firefly came to be.

            <h3>Featuring Aditi Ganeshram </h3>

            <h3>Random Journaling</h3>
            <p>
                1. I wake up early in the morning and witness the sunrise from the terrace. Somehow, the rising sun
                seems to
                uplift me, and I feel rejuvenated. I rush back down and gulp down a glass of chocolate milk and sit for
                my
                violin practice. I start with the lower speed and gradually increase to a higher speed. Somehow, I find
                solace in the positive vibrations around me; the rising sun, the sweet sound of the Koel birds chirping
                outside my window and the melodious tone of the violin. When words fail to express my grief, elements in
                nature speak in a language which none but I can understand and gain control over my emotions.


                <br><br>

                2. Painted smiles.
                <br>
                It’s someone’s birthday. You have been invited to attend the party. On reaching, people don’t
                acknowledge
                your presence and carry on with their fun. You are left all alone. The parents of the birthday boy call
                all
                the kids for a group photo. You join the crowd, and the father says, “Smile!!!” All kids grin, including
                you. But does that smile you give mean that you are happy?
                <br>
                Think about it, you weren’t treated properly at the party, and you were left all alone, and then you are
                asked to smile for a photo. Isn’t the smile you give completely fake?
                <br>
                I think you understand what a painted smile is now.

                <br><br>
                3. The sun now begins to set. Rather than engulfing me with a sense of gloom, the sunset seems to remind
                me
                that there is always an end to challenges and hardships. As I look out of my balcony, sipping a hot cup
                of
                tea, watching the birds fly blissfully to their nests, I get reminded of the fact that life is like
                sunrise
                and sunset. The sun rises like the challenges which rise in our path, but always sets down like the
                setting
                sun. These are the few moments of bliss I experience, before becoming too befuddled with my other
                desires.
