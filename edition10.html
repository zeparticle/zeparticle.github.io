            <p>Thank you so much for reading! We start back off right where we left, with our character finding their
                health bar.
            </p>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I freeze. What… am I?
                <br><br>
                What is ‘PLAYER: GL!TC#” even supposed to mean? I’ve been pondering over this for too long. I should go
                do
                something. Ah, I just realised, I haven’t eaten a single thing since I got here! Though I can’t say
                there
                were many options o pick from to eat. All I remember from the kitchen is its clean granite slabs. And
                the
                horrible smelling fridge. Maybe I should head back to see if they have anything for me to snack on
                <br><br> Wait – I haven’t even been hungry since I got here. I don’t remember feeling hungry or thirsty
                at
                any point since I woke up from the room a while ago. Speaking of, how long has it been since then? A
                couple
                hours? I look around, hunting for a clock, but there’s none to been seen. Right. I forgot time doesn’t
                exist
                here. Everything is so confusing in this new place. <br><br>
                I head on over to the kitchen, careful to stay away from the stove to avoid a repeat of last time. God,
                my
                hands are probably in worse blisters by now- huh? I’m turning my hands over, but there isn’t even a
                trace of
                the burn marks that were there before. What…? <br><br>
                I stop at the kitchen when it strikes me. Health. Percentage. It was down at 70% when my hands were
                freshly
                burnt, and as the pain reduced, the percentage went up. Does this mean… my state of health affects the
                bar
                above me?
                <br><br>
                This is extremely interesting. I can now keep track of exactly how healthy I am! I wonder what the bar
                would
                read if I caught a cold. Wait, I want to test my theory. Does me being healthy really affect the
                percentage?
                I slam down on the counter, so hard that my hand turns red, and whip my head up to catch the percentage
                before it changes again. Sure enough, the bar’s almost close to full, at 99%. By the time I look down at
                my
                hand to make sure it’s okay and back up, the bar’s back at a perfect percentage. Huh. <br><br>
                Just as before, the kitchen’s as empty as ever. There’s a couple plants lined up neatly beside the
                fridge,
                and plenty of colourful porcelain mugs hanging from wooden hangers on the wall. I wonder what the mugs
                are
                even there for, seeing as there isn’t anything to drink. Apart from water, maybe. That reminds me - I
                should
                get some water. It’s been a while since I had any. I lean over to grab a mug from its hanger and fill it
                up
                with tap water, even though I’m not really thirsty. I gulp it all down in one go, and I feel nothing.
                Nothing’s changed, nothing’s new. Well, I suppose water doesn’t do anything to me.
                <br><br> Right as I walk out, I hear some suspicious sounds coming from the direction of the rooms. I
                almost
                rush over to see what it is, till I remember what the warning told me long ago. ”It has the power to
                bring
                forth a vicious, bloodthirsty enemy and a helpful ally. Make the right choice, or take your chances with
                death.
                <br><br> I don’t know what’s hiding behind those doors… I don’t think I want to set free whatever’s
                rustling
                behind those doors. Oh no, it’s getting louder! What do I do?!
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Author’s note: Apologies for the shorter chapter! Here are the different routes in which our character
                can proceed.
                <br><br><strong>A)</strong> Go all out to help the person/creature behind the door open up, and trust in
                the fact that the one that’s behind the door could be the helpful ally that the note talks about. <br>
                <strong>B) </strong> Find a place to hide. You don’t know what’s coming out, or (if the time came) if
                you’d survive a fight with whatever came out.
                <br>
                <strong>C) </strong> Search for weapons. You never know if you are powerful enough to survive a fight,
                but that doesn’t mean you’ll back down and try to hide.
                <br><br>Do leave your votes in the comments, on our Instagram at (@zeparticle), or on our
                twitter(@ze_particle), and we’d love to see the reasons you have for choosing the option you did!

                <p id="highlight_p"><strong>Brother, I just wanted to tell you that someone once told me that death
                        was for cowards.</strong></p>
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                The Big Apple is a strange place. Here we were, heading to fight doomsday, and there the teens were
                messaging each other things like- Yo, man, how ya doin’? / Fine. How ya? / Great! And skateboarding to
                school. We headed straight for Evil’s place.
                <br><br>
                We didn’t need to go there. Evil came for us with a dragon, who she patiently explained was called Kyro
                (‘Do
                not insult my dragon, fool! He is called Kyro the Avenger!’), along with her cronies, Rebel, Alatar,
                Strength, Confidence and Mr. Croc. I simply gawked at Mr. Croc, whom I was so sure Chaos had killed.
                <br><br>
                That explained it all. Realization dawned on me. They had Death.
                <br><br>
                ‘What, Son of Moral, are you surprised? Who can conquer us now that we have Death?’ Rebel and a few
                others
                sniggered. That was when I knew we were fighting a losing cause.
                <br><br>
                ‘Let’s get to the fighting, shall we, Evil?’ Moral intervened.
                <br><br>
                ‘Why, son, we shall! Chivalrous as always. Asks permission to begin a fight.’ She turned to the young
                blue wizard. ‘Alatar, would you do the honors, please?’
                <br><br>
                A click of his wand, and a legion of undead zombies appeared. ‘More, aunt?’
                <br><br>
                ‘This is enough, Alatar. Send the armies. Tell them to go for Chaos first.’
                <br><br>
                ‘Done!’
                <br><br>
                The armies advanced towards us. Moral, Happiness, me and Fortune arranged ourselves in a circle
                around Chaos to protect him. Occasionally, three or four zombies would separate and single out
                <br><br>
                Chaos.
                <br><br>
                In that case, he held his own until we could regroup around him. He’d stare funny at one, and the
                zombie he stared at would hit himself against another zombie, knocking them both down in one go.
                After- I think- three rounds of this, Evil said, ‘Enough! I will take care of Chaos myself! Let him test
                his
                skill against his dear mother and not some unworthy zombies!’
                <br><br>
                Immediately, some zombies pulled us away. Fortune, however, broke free of their grasp and sprinted to
                fight
                beside Chaos, who was now taking care of Evil all by himself. Evil catcalled him. ‘Oh, son, you are too
                late
                save your dear brother.’ With a mighty roar, just as Fortune was by his side, Chaos fell down, retching
                and
                vomiting blood, clutching his stomach. Fortune unwrapped his brother’s tee shirt and looked into it. It
                was
                a heavy wound. ‘I- I may not survive- argh! – today, brother- I just wanted to tell you that– that- that
                someone once told me- that- death- death was for cowards.’
                <br><br>
                ‘Still the same old Chaos, aren’t ya? Well, you know what, brother? Even if I said that, I never said
                that
                death would not be avenged.’
                <br><br>
                ‘This is my last- last request- make Evil pay.’
                <br><br>
                Chaos dropped, dead.
                <br><br>
                ‘No! EVIL, YOU SHALL PAY! I shall avenge my brother!’ Tears glittering in his eyes, Fortune launched
                himself
                at Evil. Caught unaware, the two gods went grappling down the road. Seconds later, I heard
                Fortune’s voice let out a scream. Struggling, I escaped the zombie’s grasp and ran down the road.
                Fortune was dead. I sprinted back, panicking.
                <br><br>
                ‘Escape, y’all! Mom, dad, Death, escape! Fortune’s dead!’
                <br><br>
                Saying it out loud hurt me, and tears sprang into my eyes. Wiping them away, I leapt off to catch up to
                Moral, Happiness, and Death, who were calling out to me to come and hold Moral so that we could fly
                away.
                Casting a long, sad backward glance at the two dead gods, I leapt into Moral’s arms, and we flew away
                into
                the arms of safety.

                <img src="main/quote.png" style="width:50px;">
                <br>
                <p id="highlight_p"><strong>Life is like a maze. You keep getting lost. Often you think you find
                        your way, but..</strong></p>
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <p><strong>
                    We’re very curious about you, tell us about yourselves!
                </strong>
                <br>
                V: My name’s V, I'm in 12th grade. I like singing, I learn piano, I like arts and crafts, and I study,
                but only sometimes. I really love sports, like golf, football, and then swimming and running, but I'm an
                overall athlete and I'm interested in everything, golf is my main sport.
                <br><br>
                J: Hi, I'm J, but I go by jaya. I love football a lot, and I love writing. Somehow, I end up being the
                only one to submit articles for our school yearbook from my class! I dance too, I've taken part in many
                school events related to dance. This year I attended our school’s Shipwreck and reached the finals. I'm
                a bio student and a neet aspirant. I'm into sports, and I love being a leader.
                <br><br>
                <strong>2. J, do you believe in zodiac signs and the things that they symbolise?</strong>
                <br>
                J: I'm the sort of person who doesn't really believe in astrology, but I think it does influence me.
                Occasionally when I come across ‘zodiac’ posts on instagram, I find that the traits they list there
                apply to me, like being attention seeking, or outgoing, or anything really. So while it does influence
                me, I don't fully believe in them.
                <br><br>
                <strong>3. V, who do you look up to as a mentor or an inspiration?</strong>
                <br>
                V: Everyone in my family is a complete inspiration to me. Starting from my parents who’ve worked hard
                from a very young age to be where they are, to both my sisters. My older sister is currently an
                international cricketer, the vice captain of the US team. She’s really someone to look up to for me. My
                eldest sister is doing great as well, and she’s got a lot of accomplishments under her name. She used to
                be a teacher, is a yoga and swim team instructor, endorses donating to cancer patients and the cruelty
                free programme, realising the positive effects it had, inspiring me too recently to go vegan. So, yes.
                My family is my main source of inspiration.
                <br><br>
                <strong>4. V, what do you do in your free time?</strong>
                <br>
                V: my hobbies range from anything related to music, and I love writing as well! I've written two books
                so far, and both of them are up on the internet. One of them is actually a novela, based in 1950s
                madras, and about the wars going on then.
                <br><br>
                <strong>5. J and V, as the ASPL and Sports Sec. of our school you both have the power to change the
                    students’ lives, even if it is a minor change. What do you plan to do with that power?</strong>
                <br>
                J: Of course, I want to be a friendly leader, who’s approachable. I want to let people know that they
                can come to me with any ideas or suggestions they have. With my ‘power’, I want to learn my fellow
                students' and teachers’ opinions, and do as much for them and the school as I can. Of course as a Sports
                Sec., I want to develop the overall sport in our school. There are many sports that are more recognized,
                and I want to take our school forward with them. At the same time there are many differences within our
                sport, like only the boys have a cricket team, and only the girls have badminton teams, and I want to
                make that as equal as possible. I believe that if a sport exists, it should be open to everyone.
                <br><br>
                So basically when we were in seventh grade, the boys got to play interclass football and basketball
                matches, while the girls only got to play basketball. I thought we could play interclass football too,
                so i went directly to request our *pt teacher* to hold football matches for us too. In the beginning, he
                wasn't willing, as he believed girls wouldn't be interested in football, but after a week of persuasion
                he finally gave in and we had our first girls football interclass match. However, the harder part was
                getting more girls to come and play in the match, but we finally did succeed in that too. 7C ended up
                winning that year, my class!
                <br><br>
                5. V: I always thought that only being the spl meant something, but after coming into the position of
                aspl, I see now how much power I still hold, and how people respect me just the same. I'm also able to
                accomplish the same things I would have been able to do as the spl. One of my biggest ideas was creating
                the student council which I was able to go forward with. So I'm lending all of my power to all my
                juniors, which I think is the best way to use my power.I also want to fix the sanitation of all the
                bathrooms. As a part of my campaign I actually asked people about changes they'd want to see in the
                school if I was voted as the spl. Yes, it's given that I can't do everything, but I am so glad that I
                can take up a majority of the changes even as aspl.
                <br><br>
                Team p: we can assure you that our grade loves your idea and will certainly take forward the student
                council idea.
                <br><br>
                V: That means the world to me! I'm so happy that this will be carried on even after I graduate.
                <br><br>
                <strong>6. J, do you have any words of advice for aspiring leaders?</strong>
                <br>
                J: I have only one word of advice for them - be approachable. If you're approachable and friendly, you
                will end up making a great leader. They are an essential part of what makes you a good leader.Talk to
                everyone, every single person. Treat them all equally, and take in all their ideas and suggestions and
                everything they share with you with an open mind. Basically, eradicate partiality. I talk from personal
                experience, and trust me, you don't want anyone to feel left out if you are their leader.
                <br><br>
                Another thing you should have is the ability to implement ideas strongly. If you have a plan, make sure
                to execute it completely, and go as far as you can to make sure it happens. You can't be weak about what
                you want to change as a leader. To match, you need to dream big and have aspirations for the people and
                the cause you lead as well. In short, if you're approachable, friendly, ambitious and driven, you’ll
                make a wonderful leader.


                <br><br>
                <strong>7. V and J, today the two of you play huge roles in the leadership of vm. Where do you think
                    you’ll continue being a leader past our school?</strong>
                <br>
                V: Of course, our next step is college, but I think even in the smallest things - as a captain, or
                leading a sports team, or something similar. I’d like to continue being a leader even there. In the
                larger respect, I hope to be the boss of my own company at one point, perhaps the ceo. Even a middle
                management role would be amazing for me, as I could use whatever power I have then for the best. I still
                want to continue doing what I believe is good, as well as ensuring that the people I lead over are happy
                as well. I also want people to have the power to make changes they believe in and do what they want to.
                <br><br>
                J: In contrast to that, one of the main reasons I want to become a doctor is because being a doctor is
                one of the few professions that doesn't outright involve a leader or a boss. You can even have your own
                clinic! However, I do think I'd love to continue being a leader in some form or the other. Recently, I
                heard that events in college come with ‘class reps’ who lead the projects, and I'd love to be in that
                position in college too. I enjoy volunteering and being a leader, so wherever I go I think that will
                stay with me. I'd even say it’s a part of my character I can never let go of.
                <br><br>
                <strong>8. V, what is a quote that you live by?</strong>
                <br>
                V: If anything, it’d be ‘It’s not about me, it’s about the world around me.’ That's what I live by! I
                don't do much for myself, just plenty for the people around me. For example, I’ve started the student
                council for the school, to let people know that everyone can do things for people around them.
                <br><br>
                <strong>9. J, what is one of the biggest things you’ve done for our school as the sports sec?</strong>
                <br>
                J: I’d say more than what we’ve done, what we will do is of more importance. Even though we have only
                about six months left in vidya mandir, we want to change as much as we can to better our school and make
                it more student friendly. Ask us this question in six months, and we'll give you a whole list.We have
                big plans, and we hope we can see them being implemented too!
                <br><br>
                <strong>10. To finish off, we have the most important question for you. What do you think life
                    is?</strong>
                <br>
                V: life is like a maze. You keep getting lost. Often you think you find your way, but you just hit a
                dead end. Life is really just a bunch of dead ends, isn't it? Then finally, you hit the last dead end.
                People call it death or something. (not to be the pessimist, but what if you make it out of the maze?)
                Then you just get into another one. And that’s the full circle right there.
                <br><br>

                J: Honestly, I think life as a whole is just ironic. The things you used to love don't seem as appealing
                anymore, and things you used to hate are things you miss now. It starts from always wanting to go out,
                or meet your friends, but after a point all you want to do is focus on yourself. Not just this, there's
                quite a few more you’ll find if you look closely. Something I think everyone with siblings would
                understand is wanting to spend time with your siblings now. Maybe when you were younger they always
                called you to join them, but you just had better things to do, and now you want to hang out with them
                but in turn, they are busy too, and you regret missing the opportunities you got with them. It would
                have made them happy, but we just missed out. I think the people who give us the most affection and love
                end up being the people we ignore the most, and we just don't realise that for a long, long time.
                <br><br>
                Also, thank you so much for having us! I really enjoyed the interview and interacting with you.

            </div>
            <br><br>
            <p>Hello, I want to thank some of my friends, Aravind and Bhargavi from the Particle team and Aayush a
                member of
                the Blah for helping me with this edition’s Brain Factory produce I’m kind of running out of ideas
                :skull:
                <br><br>
                What if humans had absolute full control over every part of their body? Like we do, but we just can’t
                bring
                ourselves to do certain things like lick our elbows or maybe even move our muscles in a certain way- I
                feel
                like life would be easier- or not idk the thought of being capable of doing 40 push ups sounds cool.
                <br><br> What if Eve was infertile. <br><br> When you eat a burger do you slightly push the patty off
                the
                burger, just a small bit so that when you’re done with the burger you have a small piece of patty to end
                the
                meal with- If you do, you’re a cool human being. I do this with all my food, like, keep a little bit of
                the
                best part for the last to end the meal on the best part. My friend Aravind calls this TLB- The Last
                Bite.
                <br><br> Pizza and pasta would actually go pretty good together. Like pasta as a pizza topping- or
                pieces of
                pizza in the pasta? <br><br> When Santa delivers gifts, he doesn’t actually do it for 12 hours, he
                actually
                does it for 24 hours- but it’s only a night, because of the various time zones- I feel like that was
                obvious
                but just had to be stated. Also does he do some kind of strategic planning with the elves because I
                would
                love to take a look into the list and the order in which he gives the gifts- <br><br> How do I wake up
                and
                forget my dream within seconds- like it’s always on the tip of my tongue but I can’t guess what it is.
                But
                then somehow later in the day it all comes back to me and I can remember everything clearly, I even have
                a
                journal filled with my dreams it’s a pretty one to jot down dreams and maybe draw a few too- you should
                try.
                <br><br> Cannibals wouldn’t be good friends to hang out with. What if one of them got hungry- <br><br>
                Do
                y’all also have those moments when you sit on the couch at night, and then feel tired and sleepy, and
                decide
                to sleep. But you get into bed, put on the blanket and switch off the light. Suddenly, you don’t feel
                sleepy
                at all and have a billion thoughts and how you forgot to do that one important thing that you told
                yourself
                to do the night before? I really hate when this happens but then again I use this opportunity for 3am
                thoughts so I guess it all works out well- <br><br> Showers. The place where imagination soars. Well,
                for me
                at least. I'm not kidding- The same applies for when you go to sleep. You suddenly think of a million
                things
                at once and just can't fall asleep. <br><br> Continuing - showers are the one place where I have no
                mental
                stimulation at all and it’s really calming to be alone with your thoughts and it’s nice to have that
                time to
                just think because all the other times I’m caught up in something, even when I’m going to sleep I either
                put
                on some music or go to sleep because I’m that tired. With that being said it’s also kind of scary to
                step
                back for a moment and just be alone with nothing at all but your thoughts- <br><br> Coder’s note: I have
                no
                idea how you execute this so- favourite unnie aka our editor asked paddy if he had a stellar idea for
                the
                gRaNd tEnTh eDiTiOn but paddy didn’t, so now you get to use your imagination to fill in a legendary
                thought
                here and if you like, share it with us in the comment section. Bhargavi if you see this we conspired
                against
                you to add this in :)
                <br><br>
                that is all – see you next edition :>>

                <br>
                <p id="highlight_p"><strong>We needed to get out of here, fast. There was no way out, as the monster
                        kept blowing out the fire, and moved extremely swiftly in the dark. </strong></p>
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <p>We entered the forest. Our first problem was a big, giant wall, which was paper-thin. “What kind of an
                obstacle is this? I’m sure even the backside of my sword could pierce this thin wall.” said Leo. He was
                wrong. No matter how much he stabbed, he couldn’t pierce the thin white wall. Amber had a go too, but
                not
                even her bullets left a dent. I tried blasting it with ice, fire and electricity at the same time, but
                it
                STILL didn’t work. <br><br>
                Then, Amber got a brainwave. She told us to combine our weapons and then attack the wall. Leo tapped his
                wand on Amber’s sword and thorny branches grew. I flamed up Amber’s sword (though the branches
                surprisingly
                didn’t burn up). She shot at the wall, while also stabbing the thorny-flaming-gun-sword. Leo formed
                exploding berries in his hand, and threw them at the wall, while I bonked the wall with the sharp sides
                of
                the sapphire, occasionally setting the wall on ice. <br><br>
                It still didn’t work. <br><br>
                Then we tried attacking at the same time. The wall tore, as if it was made by paper. <br><br>
                “Gosh,” said Leo, “if this is some childish ‘Teamwork is Amazing!’ kind of thing, I swear- “ <br><br>
                “Looks like it is.” I said. <br><br>
                We walked deeper into the forest. We could only go in a straight line, as there was some invisible
                barrier
                blocking us from going the other way, and even when we tried the same thing we did on the paper wall, it
                didn’t work. Then came our next problem, and it was a big maze. But this was no normal maze. <br><br>
                Firstly, we couldn’t fly to the top (oh, I forgot, Arbeal taught me how to fly, holding my staff
                backwards,
                and forming wind blowing down), because there was another barrier. Secondly, the barrier was not
                invisible,
                so inside the maze it was really dark, but I just set a stick lying on the ground on fire, so we had a
                torch.
                <br><br> The walls of the maze were of dark grey stone. It looked a lot like a tunnel. To ensure that we
                didn’t get lost, Leo created some sort of glowing weed, and threw pieces on the ground as we walked, so
                we
                wouldn’t go back to where we were. Then it happened. <br><br>
                We walked a step, and suddenly we were shifted somewhere else in the maze. <br><br>
                “Uh, Adam, what just- “ <br><br>
                “LOOK OUT!” I said, as a huge metal saw passed over our head. Thank goodness Leo ducked in time. “What
                the-
                “ <br><br>
                “Does this maze have a mind of its own?” Amber asked. <br><br>
                “Is that even possible?” I mumbled. Little did I know, much worse things were possible.
                <br><br> “Oh, you haven’t seen the half of it.” <br><br>
                So now, we had no idea where we were. We knew that the maze wasn’t safe anymore, we couldn’t backtrack
                our
                steps because we shifted somewhere else, and also that it was even darker here. The silver lining? There
                was
                only one way, straight.
                <br><br> We walked ahead, and it got even darker, so we found and another piece of wood and lit its tip.
                Did
                I forget to tell you that the maze had its own life? A cold wind blew, and our torches were put out. Now
                we
                had no light. Yay. We heard small grunts behind us, along with creaks like metal. Turning around
                immediately, Amber drew her weapon. Leo and I followed suit. We felt a swift gust of wind, and suddenly,
                Amber’s cheek was mildly bleeding. Something cut her. I lit my torch again, and for a brief moment, I
                saw a
                monster. <br><br>
                It was around a few feet taller than us. It was shaped weirdly, like an actual stickman, minus the head.
                So
                it was basically like the trunk of a tree, but metal and grey, with even darker grey arms and legs. It
                said,
                “grrr”, but with a creaky and deep voice. <br><br>
                Then my torch went out. <br><br>
                As I lit it again, we saw the monster again, but it was elsewhere, behind us. The torch went out again.
                This
                time, the monster cut the side of Leo’s left arm. It must’ve been deep, because Leo screamed in pain for
                a
                second. I lit the torch again. <br><br> “What the-”
                <br><br> Whoosh. My torch went out once again. At this point, it was getting annoying. I threw the torch
                aside, and set the sapphire of my staff on fire. <br><br>
                This time, I saw the monster attack. <br><br>
                It didn’t move at all, but it revealed what it used to attack Leo and Amber. It reached out its claw of
                a
                hand, and tried to scratch me. My torch went out again, and something scratch me really badly in the
                chest.
                It stung like crazy, and as I lit my staff again, the monster was in yet another direction. The cut felt
                like poison, which I suspected it was. We needed to get out of here, fast. There was no way out, as the
                stupid monster kept blowing out the fire, and moved extremely swiftly in the dark. <br><br> Unless…
                <br><br> I knew what to do. <br><br>
                “Leo, throw the glowing weed on the floor, now!” <br><br>
                “Why?”
                <br><br> “JUST DO IT!” I yelled. <br><br>
                And so he did. I expected something to happen, and it did. <br><br>

            <h3>Featuring Mathangi</h3>
            <p>
                <i>I’d love to begin by quoting from the Harry Potter series, where Professor Dumbledore says,
                    “Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the
                    light.”</i>
                <br><br>
                Covid-19, as we all know, has changed the lives of many, mostly for the worse. As a middle school
                student who has been unable to go to school for a year, I miss my friends, teachers and school
                environment the most. The school is a second home to school kids, and schools being shut down has had a
                severe effect on poor children. While I’m able to interact with my teachers and friends through digital
                means, I regret that children from rural areas and poor homes did not have such a privilege. I
                understand this well because my father works closely to uplift education for children from very backward
                rural areas through a voluntary organisation named Asha for Education. Asha for Education helps
                government schools in rural areas by appointing teachers, supports the mid-day meal scheme, provides
                books and uniforms and funds building repairs and libraries for students.
                <br><br>
                Before Covid-19, I have had several chances to interact with school children from these areas. So, I
                would like to share the story of Asha’s mini schools that have struggled to help such children continue
                their learning.
                <br><br>
                When the virus came to India January last year, all public places were closed. After a few months,
                private schools started online classes. But what about government schools supported by Asha? The
                children in those schools didn’t have electronic devices like phones and computers to attend online
                classes. Asha volunteers understood the importance of continued learning during the pandemic and decided
                to start small schools in villages where the teachers lived. At first, the plan was for students to
                gather in small batches at school with social distancing and masks. But the plan did not work as the
                government declared that schools had to be shut down. The program then thought of sending the children
                to the teachers houses but quickly realised that some of the houses were too small to accommodate the
                students even in batches. They found an innovative solution to this problem by asking the teachers to
                conduct classes in public spaces like nearby temples or under trees.
                <br><br>
                Asha faced a number of challenges to run mini schools. Teachers found it difficult to travel to the
                villages at times, there were not enough teachers, safety precautions were hard to follow and funding
                during Covid-19 was very hard to raise.
                <br><br>
                There were miracles in between, however. When the pandemic eased, one Asha teacher used her tiny home
                that housed seniors and her mother helped prepare food for the children who came to learn. Her husband
                helped buy teaching materials too!
                <br><br>
                Asha gave importance to safety first with the use of masks, hand washing and distancing.
                <br><br>
                A short time after the first mini schools started in June, 12 mini- schools were already operational!
                <br><br>
                Volunteers, however, could not bring mini schools to Chennai because of the swift spread of the virus.
                Since the start of the development of the mini-schools, 18 of these schools started functioning, across
                Thiruvallur, Thoothukudi and Villupuram districts. As these projects went on, many teachers who
                travelled to nearby towns asked if they could establish mini-schools in their villages which were not
                under the Asha program and the organisation helped them. The Asha for Education program has done wonders
                for not only these poor children. But this would not have been successful without great effort and
                sacrifice from teachers, their families and the families of the children who participated.
                <br><br>
                These people remembered to turn on the light, didn’t they?
