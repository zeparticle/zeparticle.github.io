            <h1>Society versus Reality: Body Shaming </h1>
            <h3>By Moukthika</h3>
            <p>Fat.<br>
                It’s not a bad word, it does not mean ugly, it does not mean lazy, it does not mean unhealthy, it does
                not
                mean worthless. People come in different shapes and sizes, and that’s just how it works. <br><br>

                Body shaming is a bit of hard topic to understand if you haven’t been through it yourself. Think about
                those
                people who have felt terrible about their bodies because of their friends, family, strangers, and trolls
                on
                the internet and the walls on school bathrooms.<br><br>

                It is ridiculously infuriating when people are unnecessarily mean about other people’s bodies. There was
                no
                reason to make that comment, what is so difficult about staying quiet and leaving a person not feeling
                bad
                about themselves?<br><br>

                What do they gain from making someone feel horrible about themselves? Nothing, maybe a fleeting moment
                of
                power but that’s gone as soon as it comes, so why? No amount of reasoning can justify this. Don’t joke
                about
                people’s bodies even if you’re friends with them. They may laugh it off, but deep down they feel
                worthless.<br><br>

                To all the boys, you’re absolutely beautiful, and girls, you’re incredibly handsome, regardless of your
                body
                type. Society’s crazy expectations do not dictate your worth. Exercise to be fit, not skinny. Eat to
                nourish
                your body and always ignore the haters, doubters and unhealthy standards of beauty. You’re worth more
                than
                you think. <br><br>

                Something I have noticed now are people are obsessed over their own and each other’s height. What even
                is
                the point of that? We are wonderful the way we are. Tall girls/boys have amazing and beautiful long
                legs. So
                be proud, you can’t change it and there is nothing wrong in being tall. To all my short folks, remember
                that
                dynamite comes in small packages.<br><br>
                So always remember that your body is not wrong, society is. Height and weight are just numbers. Be proud
                of
                who you are and let’s stop body shaming. Not only others, but ourselves too.

            <h1>The medicine (Chapter 2)</h1>
            <h3>Original:Indira <br>
                Adaptation:Paddy</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                It felt as if all the light in the world had been sucked away by a black hole. The sky was a blanket of
                darkness, the stars were pretty splatters of light, and the moon had vanished, gone away like it had
                never
                existed at all.<br><br>
                I stopped to rest but something didn't feel right, I felt as if something was chasing after me, taking
                advantage of the few minutes I stopped to take a breath. I slept in fear that night. My imagination had
                wandered free, what would I be doing the next day? <br><br>
                I woke up to see the sun starting to rise. It was a beautiful sunrise, the warm tones of the sun and the
                light blue sky made for an extravagant umber, the clouds were all silver-lined, it was a breath-taking
                view.
                It was truly a sight to behold, a feast for my drowsy eyes. <br><br>
                A few birds were chirping happily, sitting on a tree like they had not a care in the world. I hoped and
                dreamt that one day, I would be at least half as happy as they were. As I gazed at the magnificent
                scenery,
                I thought as soon as I had gotten my hands on the medicine and gotten it back to the hospital I knew I
                would
                be one step closer to happiness. Staying in that other hospital for a month really got to me, I was
                almost
                forgetting how the hospital I was familiar with looked. Despite it being my place, my home, it was
                verging
                at the end of my memory. I reminded myself that I was on this mission just for them.<br><br>
                I was so lost in thought while I walked along that I failed to notice there was a tremendous stretch of
                crops. In the vast expanse of land, there were vegetables, fruits, trees, and so many varieties of
                flowers!
                Tulips, roses, daisies, gladioli, orchids, and so many more! It felt like I was in Wonderland ever after
                the
                dreary month at the hospital. <br><br>
                There were plants for as far as my vision could go, all the way until the horizon and looked as if they
                touched the sky! I was in luck as I had run out of food too, I ate as much as I could because I knew I
                would
                need it, and stuffed some more in my baggy pockets and backpack. After the meal I reminded myself I
                needed
                to get to the medicine, after all, I was the only one who could get it.<br><br>
                At the corner of my, I could see a dark, gloomy forest, and I knew that was where I needed to go. As I
                got
                closer, I found out it was more of a boggy marsh than the woods. The forest floor was covered with
                leaves
                from green, yellow, orange and burgundy. Ferns and small plants growing here and there and green
                velvet-like
                plants grew on rocks and dead wood while the trees were covered in moss, the soil was almost clay-like
                to
                the touch. If you didn't know any better you could mistake it for a swamp, the only thing by which you
                could
                tell it was a forest was the enormous canopy, the trees were so tall and thick, they prevented almost
                all
                the sunlight from reaching the lush forest ground. <br><br>
                As the light gradually faded behind me, I couldn’t see a thing. It was almost as if I was blind. I
                reached
                into my backpack and tried to find my flashlight but I kept grabbing other things instead. After a few
                minutes of grumbling and searching, I found some matches and a candle instead, not what I was looking
                for
                but by then I had given up by then. I stroked the matchstick along the side of the box and was almost
                scared
                out of my wits at the sight in front of me. I didn’t even notice the matchstick burn out till it scalded
                my
                fingers. When I saw what was in front of me. I screamed I could hear birds flying away and animals
                scurrying
                off when they heard the blood-curdling scream. <br><br>
                There was a human skull in front of me, at my feet.<br><br>
                It was almost like... someone had left it there, just for me.

            <h1>Insecurity and its cure</h1>
            <h3>By Vedika</h3>
            <p>
                Insecurity. <br><br>
                The feeling of inadequacy that a lot of us experience from time to time. It makes us feel anxious about
                everything (school, work, looks, etc). But what causes it? <br><br>
                Insecurities are brought on when we recognize differences between ourselves and others, either on our
                own or
                when someone else points it out. They occur when we experience a consequence for being different than
                others
                or when we feel that we don’t measure up to what we “should be”. For example, when a child is teased at
                a
                playground for being bigger than others, the child could grow up feeling insecure about their
                weight.<br><br>
                Insecure people always live in fear of judgement. They avoid meeting new people because they don’t
                believe
                that they’re good enough. They never think they’re good enough. They could be the smartest, nicest, most
                driven person, but they’ll never see themselves that way. They aren’t true to themselves. They try to be
                like chameleons in social gatherings or when meeting people so they can try to change how they are
                because
                they’re not comfortable with themselves.<br><br>
                Insecurity makes people live in a world of denial. They deny everything, good or bad, and end up staying
                on
                their unhappy track. They’re always paranoid about whether other people are judging them and think the
                other
                people talk about them behind their back. These people almost always end up missing out on the good
                things
                in life because they’re so rooted to the fact that they’re not good enough or that anything they do is
                bound
                to fail.<br><br>
                Feeling insecure can often lead to being self conscious and can end up making you lose your self esteem.
                In
                the long run, insecurity can really affect mental health in many ways. People say, ‘love yourself’ and
                ‘stay
                true to yourself‘, but you don’t actually know how to. Really, not many people do.<br><br>
                Many people think that the solution to stop being insecure is to hide their insecurities but it’s really
                not. We cannot hide something that we are insecure about all the time. Even if we could, that would be
                exhausting. In the long run, the only cure for insecurity is self acceptance. When we stop worrying
                about
                what others may think of us, is when we can truly shed our insecurities because we no longer care
                whether or
                not we are judged for them. When we accept ourselves, we find that most people do not judge us, and that
                those who do, don’t matter. <br><br>
                There are more steps to get rid of insecurity though it won’t happen overnight. The second thing to do
                is to
                affirm your value. Put yourself before others, in all ways. Adding more self care to your daily routine
                can
                help you counter negative thoughts and can help bring up your self esteem and self worth. <br><br>
                This is very important - Embrace the awkward.<br><br>
                There are definitely going to be moments in life where you screw up but that’s just a part of life.
                Embrace
                it. And the next time you try that, you’ll do better. Don’t beat yourself up about it because that’s not
                going to help in anyway. Forgive yourself and understand that by making these mistakes, you’re not any
                less
                good. Spend more time with people you love. As soon as you cut out the toxic thoughts from your life,
                you’ll
                feel a lot better. And do things that make you happy. Do things that you love whether it’s cooking, or
                working out, or anything else. <br><br>
                Last but certainly not least, try new things. The more you push yourself to try things that are out of
                your
                comfort zone , the more you start embracing yourself. There are some smaller steps you can add to your
                daily
                routine to help, like trying new food, or cooking new dishes, basically trying new things every day.
                Maybe
                learn a song, or learn a dance, maybe workout, focus on you. If you’re an avid music listener, listen to
                a
                couple of songs you love every day, and sing to your heart’s content and don’t worry if others hear you.
                You’re fabulous just the way you are.<br><br>
                To the people reading this, I may not know you well, but I highly advise you to be self accepting and to
                treat yourself.

            <h1>Why I became a doctor</h1>
            <h3>By Bhargavi</h3>
            <p>
                Ever since she was 5, all she wanted was to become an architect. “To build is to create, and to not
                destroy.” was the motto she lived by. Her ambition was to build housing for the poor who couldn’t afford
                it.
                <br><br>
                Every day, she walked to school with Tara; a shy quiet girl just like herself. If either of them were
                seen
                alone elsewhere, they were the opposite of attention seekers, drawing as little attention to themselves
                as
                possible. But on the 20 minute walk from the apartment they both lived in, on the peaceful curving road
                filled with birds chirping and lush green trees on either side, they talked only about themselves. With
                laughter sounding as pretty as those birds, these walks made ever-lasting memories. The pair of them did
                prefer keeping to themselves, but it all seemed to perish when the other was around. Any walls against
                humanity were broken down between them, and both felt better when the other was around.<br><br>
                Except on one fateful day, it all changed. She pointed at a car — an unlikely appearance in their small
                town— on the road they were walking on, telling Tara how perfect she thought it was. Tara, in awe of the
                glossy black car, walked a little too far into the road when the car swerved wildly. Tara’s smiling face
                turned to shock as she landed with a thud, blood streaming down her face. Her eyes started looking more
                to
                the back of her head, than front. And they were turning misty white.<br><br>
                Stunned, she knelt down and screamed for help. The mechanical wail of the ambulance soothed her ears,
                taking
                the pair of them in, though she insisted in a voice hoarse from screaming that it was only Tara that
                needed
                help. The paramedics in the ambulance started checking Tara right away. They connected her to a machine
                that
                beeped quite loud, though not constantly. When she asked what it was for, the paramedics explained that
                it
                was to monitor her heart. And that it was struggling to hold Tara up. Thankfully, the hospital was only
                a
                few minutes away. Tara was rushed into a room where nobody except medical staff could be. She was
                transferred into a room after what seemed like an eternity, and was finally allowed visitors.<br><br>
                She met a heavily bandaged Tara, who was mumbling something along the lines of, “Thank the doctors,
                okay?
                Please thank them.” followed by a weak but genuine smile.<br><br>
                That was where everything changed, and something new began building inside her.<br><br>
                That was when she decided to become a doctor. “They’ll need their lives if they need housing,” she
                decided.
                And those smiles in return were definitely part of the change of heart too.<br><br>
                Her resolve grew exactly like how Tara healed. With crutches at first, tentative. And slowly morphing
                into a
                few steps, spurs of confidence. When Tara could finally walk to school alongside her, she knew exactly
                what
                she wanted. She wanted to build people again when they broke. After all, to build is to create, and to
                not
                destroy.<br><br>

                Why I became a doctor,<br>
                Dr. Meera Ramanan.

                Young at Heart<br><br>
                I knew a man, old of age <br>
                So weak he could hardly turn a page. <br>
                But his brain was sharp as a dart, <br>
                And this man was quite young at heart. <br><br>

                He sat in his chair, not walking about <br>
                But even so he never gave a pout. <br>
                A cheery man, full of life, <br>
                He sat there chatting with his wife. <br><br>

                He was never bored and never weary,<br>
                If someone is in the room they're never dreary.<br>
                This man who was sharp as a dart<br>
                Lived his entire life young at heart.<br><br>

                I saw Her.<br>
                Moments ago, and yet She’s unrecognisable. <br>
                Confusion drowns me. <br>
                I don’t recognise it just yet, but something about it makes her seem like a long lost friend. <br>
                Foreign, and yet Known. Could she be? <br>
                It hits me all at once. <br>
                Overwhelming, would be an understatement for what I’m feeling. <br>
                Suffocating.<br>
                It is a long lost friend after all. <br>
                a sense of familiarity surrounds Her, but she’s been gone too long for me to truly know. <br>
                I push her away as fast as I can; now that I recognise Her. <br>
                All she does is wish well for me. <br>
                But it’s too late. <br>
                She’s gone now, probably baffled by my reaction. <br>
                How I long she’ll come back though.<br><br>

                Is it a sign?
                <br>
                A sign of the impending doom?<br>
                And as I begin to give up,<br>
                I see in distance,<br>
                A figure too pristine,<br>
                She flashes a smile at me with a bowl of water and a heart of gold,<br>
                I fly to her with gratitude<br>
                Maybe there is hope and<br>
                Maybe I have just been looking in the wrong places...<br>

            Are jams just pickled fruits with sugar instead of salts and spices?<br><br>
            There could be so many more colours than what the human eye could see and we would never know. In fact we
            wouldn’t know if what you and I see as a certain colour like green is even remotely close, we might be
            seeing totally different colours but we would never know because we can’t experience life through different
            beings’ eyes. Scary if you think about it. <br><br>
            If “anything is possible” isn't it possible for something to be impossible? Life is trippy bro. <br><br>
            What if books were in dark mode. Instead of having white paper we could have black paper with white ink. And
            as a friend said, “blackeners instead of whiteners”.<br><br>
            This is a well-known fact but the fear of long words is Hippopotomonstros-esquippedaliophobia. Geniuses.
            They totally did it for the memes. <br><br>
            Technically according to the big bang theory, every single thing that exists today was just because of one
            little atom. Should I be scared?<br><br>
            In the movie ‘Cinderella’ the fairy godmother told Cinderella that all her magic vanishes at 12am but the
            shoes still survived, and the fact that Cinderella was the only one in the entire kingdom to have that shoe
            size is suspicious. <br><br>
            Santa is the opposite of robbery; he breaks into your house and gives you presents. <br><br>

            Uber is the opposite of a kidnap, you get into someone’s car and they take you home. <br><br>

            <h1>Switching Back to Offline School – Are We Ready?
            </h1>
            <h3>Aravind & Paddy</h3>
            <p>The pandemic and quarantine led us to go to school in a new way. We haven’t been inside our new
                classrooms or
                even seen our wooden benches with years of scraped and repainted paint in more than a year now. Gone are
                the
                assemblies each morning where hundreds of us droned the prayer half-awake wishing we were back in bed
                dreaming about a million different things. Now any social interaction is removed, all our progress in
                making
                face-to-face conversation destroyed. It’s not kilometers away now, only a few feet away, on our laptops.
                Now, I really don’t think the pandemic will do away in a few months or even one or two years, but when
                it
                does, will we be ready for our school? <br><br>

                For spending 9 long, dreaded periods instead of just 4 in the comfort of home? Waking up at six in the
                morning again, and much more homework. For being watched during tests, in person. For not being able to
                chat
                with different friends on numerous newly created texting apps. Would we be able to catch up to how fit
                we
                were last year? Would it be possible for each of us to run endless circles on the school grounds like we
                used to? Most importantly, being surrounded by actual people? Not the virtual icons of trees and things
                that
                only represent your friends, but people you’d have to make eye contact with and laugh at jokes for, not
                use
                the emoji to satisfy a requirement. <br><br>


                We’ve made so many friends from other sections and even grades during lockdown when earlier whom we
                never
                even used to spare a glance to. Will we still stay friends? <br><br>

                Further, this year, all our states of mental health have changed drastically. It isn’t fair at all that
                we’re being confined to tiny screens, and our parents telling us to get of it. Because even if we spend
                4
                hours on it, it doesn’t make up for the social interaction we had a year and a half ago. The number of
                people we met daily would average to at least 20 before the pandemic, ranging from people at school, to
                after school classes, the walks back home or the van rides back home, and anything else. Now it’s about
                a
                tenth, them being our parents, and maybe more if you have siblings. How are we going to adapt to 20
                again?
                Can we do that quickly enough?<br><br>

                These are the questions that have been running through our minds, as school ends and hope for the next
                academic year begins. Despite everything, we hope that things can get back to normal as soon as
                possible,
                and we can see for ourselves what would happen. <br><br>

        <h1>Meet the particle team!</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Varsha</strong>: Our amazing comic illustrator! She finds inspiration in the small, vague
            details hidden in the world, and incorporates them into her everything.<br>
            <strong>Jyotsna</strong>: The first to introduce the bob obsession, she’s the peacekeeper (I see you
            hunger games fans), is on the tranquil side of our team, and writes stellar articles.<br>
            <strong>Aadhav</strong>: our talented pianist! He loves anything musical, from singing to of course,
            playing the piano. He loves sports too, and is an avid Agatha Christie fan.<br>
            <strong>Moukthika</strong>: Our Artist! Her art skills are next level - Even buzzfeed agrees that she’s
            artsy and she cooks really well. <br>
            <strong>Bhargavi</strong>: She’s our editor and personal kpop spammer; expert at burning toast. She’s
            also everyone’s (self proclaimed) favourite unnie.<br>
            <strong> Vedika</strong>: The one team member who’s up before the sun with a smile, she’s our motivator.
            She’s a part of our photography gang, and contributes art and articles every other edition too!<br>
            <strong>Aravind</strong>: Fellow youtube animator addict, he's known to be talkative and lighten the
            mood anywhere he goes! He contributes both articles and stories.<br>
            <strong>Paddy</strong>: known by the name ‘Evil.’, he’s our evil, chaotic teammate. He’s the inventor of
            a language we’re proud to use. He talks equally as often as Favorite Unnie, and is the author of the
            regular section, 3 am brain factory produce. <br>
            <strong>Sriram</strong>: A voracious reader with his interest in a variety of genres, his fingers can do
            magic with both pen and brush. He loves cooking and eats cricket for breakfast, lunch and dinner. <br>
            <strong> Anhiti</strong>: The youngest here, she makes the website for the particle. Famous for
            convincing us to save the reefs – budding artist and author. (Don’t tell her, but she’s basically kpop
            spammer #2.)<br>
