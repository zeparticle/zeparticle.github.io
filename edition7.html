        <h3>By Bhargavi</h3>
        <p>Welcome to the game of choice.
            <br><br>
            Where you get to pick the way our character’s life goes.
            <br><br>
            This goes without saying, but try not to kill them please.
            <br><br>
            <hr>
        <p>
            <br><br>
            I’m locked inside this place… I have no memory of how I got here. I don’t think there’s anyone else in here
            with me, or maybe there are people asleep like I was behind the locked doors I found. I wonder why only the
            door to my room was left open… did they know I would wake up first?
            <br><br>
            It’s stupid to ask myself, I know, but who even is the ‘they’ I’m referring to? Who, or what put me here?
            Was what brought me here even human? Why am I here? I have so many questions.
            <br><br>
            I’ve walked around the place I seem to be stuck in. There are 5 rooms, including the one I found myself in.
            All the other rooms were locked… I don’t even want to know what waits behind the closed doors. There’s a
            kitchen, with a stove that won’t go out. It’s a small stove, won’t cause much harm, but it’s simply not
            going out no matter how much I try. There seems to be a strange key-shaped hole in it… I wonder what that
            means. There’s a fridge that doesn’t work, and a horrible stench of rotten food wafts out when I open it. Or
            maybe something else is causing the smell. I refuse to hold it open long enough to find out.
            <br><br>
            There aren’t any bathrooms in sight. Guess we’ll cross that bridge when we get there.
            <br><br>
            Despite how much this place looks like a house, I don’t see a front door, or something that will lead me
            out. I’ve looked all over… the windows are nailed shut. There’s no visible way out.
            <br><br>
            I see a staircase that I didn’t see before. I’m sure I walked around the whole place. There’s no way I could
            have missed a giant, grand looking stairway to downstairs. This only proves my theories.
            <br><br>
            I’m locked in some kind of paranormal, fantastical place.
            <br><br>
            Or I’m hallucinating. Big time.
            <br><br>
            After an internal debate, I take the stairway down. There are no lights here… or windows. Boy, I wouldn’t
            know if it was day or night in this place. I can walk down a stairway I apparently imagined. This makes it
            clear that it’s no hallucination.
            <br><br>
            This place seems to be a long passageway. Fire-lit torches pop up along as I walk, right at my pace and
            thankfully illuminating my path so I’m not walking into pitch-black air. When I reach the supposed end, I’m
            standing face to face with a stone wall.
            <br><br>
            Well, that was disappointing. I hoped to find some kind of clue as to where I was, who brought me here,
            anything, but all I see is a stone wall. I turn around to walk back down the path and up the stairs to the
            house I was in. In a last-ditch attempt, I turn around to see if I’ve missed anything.
            <br><br>
            To my immense surprise, the stone wall… vanished. In its place, there is a note with tiny handwriting on it,
            floating down from the ceiling, like someone just dropped it. Of course, I walk back to it, and pick it up
            to read it. It says
            <br><br>
            “As soon as you finish reading this note, it will transform into something that will help you leave this
            place. I originally had no intention of letting you out, but seeing as you’ve made it all the way here, I
            suppose I must abide by my own rules and allow you to leave. If you thought it would be easy, you are hugely
            mistaken. I have only one thing left to say now. Be careful with what you will hold in seconds, it has the
            power to bring forth a vicious, bloodthirsty enemy and a helpful ally. Make the right choice, or take your
            chances with death.”
            <br><br>
            Right as I read the word ‘death’, the paper burns away with an invisible flame, and leaves a key in its
            place.
            <br><br>
            Could this be… a key to one of the doors upstairs?
            <br><br>
            I could try opening them! Yes, finally, someone to keep me company in this strange place- wait. What if…
            what if what the note said is real, and an enemy of mine waits behind a door? How am I to know what’s behind
            which door? I don’t know what to do!
            <br><br>
        </p>

            options below, (if you’d like to, you can even leave a reason as to what made you choose the option you
            did!) and leave them in the comment section below. You can also answer the poll on our Instagram story!
            <br><br>
            <strong>A)</strong> They pick up the key, and try a door at random. We just hope for the best.<br>
            <strong>B)</strong> They pick up the key, but hold onto it and look for further clues revealing hints about
            the mysteries behind the doors.<br>
            <strong>C)</strong> They leave the key in the dingy basement place. This whole thing is extremely
            suspicious, what if the key is dangerous?

        <h1 style="color:#a7cdbd; text-shadow:2px 2px #bbe1c3; ">The Chronicles Of Joy - Chapter 4: Fortune </h1>
        <h3>By Sriram</h3>
        <p>
            Y’know, in most cases, telling the king of the universe that the queen of the universe has died isn’t a good
            thing. The king is most likely to chase you screaming, ‘YOU LET MY WIFE DIE, FOOL! I WILL FIND YOU AND
            PERSONALLY KILL YOU, BRING YOU BACK ALIVE AND KILL YOU AGAIN!’
            <br><br>
            Fortune was no exception. So here was I, running while screaming at the top of my lungs. He was
            intimidating. He had a very sharp sword. I stopped running, brandished my sword and faced him, trying to
            resolve my problems by talking. ‘Listen, brother-in-law. The plan for killing Evil was Luck’s idea, not
            mine. The fault that she died under Evil’s stroke also had nothing to do with me. You’re chasing me with no
            real reason.’ Fortune became very still and unmoving. Suddenly, he fell right into my hands and hugged me.
            ‘The-TheThe only- The only wife I had. I lost her- I lost her. The-The blame is not yours, brother- It’s-
            It’s mine.’ He straightened up and brushed his tears, making up his resolve.
            <br><br>

            ‘I’d bring my wife back, Evil- Watch out, mother. You always said I was a good swordsman, and gifted me with
            my own sword. This sword shall be the end of you.’
            <br><br>

            ‘Whoa. Is that for sure? You-You know that for sure? Asking ‘cause that can grant me a lot of peace.’
            <br><br>

            ‘I know the outcome, brother. But I also know that sharing is not in my place to do it. The outcome will be
            affected by that.’
            <br><br>

            My thoughts were racing. If he cared so much about changing the outcome, it had to be a good outcome, right?
            Because if he went worrying about bad outcomes changing into good ones, he’d lose his street cred. Inwardly,
            I grinned to myself. I was a hundred percent sure that we’d end up beating Evil in the end.
            <br><br>

            ‘Brother. Let’s go. Moral and Happiness are here. Now, where did you say Evil’s new domain was?’
            <br><br>

            ‘In the Big Apple in New York.’
            <br><br>
            ‘Let’s go. Moral, you ready?’
            <br><br>

            Dad came up grinning, waving his stick. ‘Happiness?’ Mom bared her claws.

            <br><br>

            ‘Losing Luck has impacted us all, and I can easily feel the grief and rage. Let’s pummel that grief and rage
            on Evil, shall we, now?’ Mom said. Cheering, we all went down from the heavens into New York.
            <br><br>

            ‘Whoa. Look at the Big Apple now, Happiness! It’s beautiful. Remember the day when-’
            <br><br>
            ‘Dad.’
            <br><br>

            ‘Sorry, son. What’s Evil’s door number, now?’
            <br><br>

            ‘I don’t remember all that. All I know is that it’s green with a red finish on the roof.’ Fortune soared up
            into the air, searching the streets for a house that matched my description. ‘Dang, that guy can fly? I
            checked Amazon and IKEA and Flipkart for wings like that, but I couldn’t- Oh.’
            <br><br>

            I stopped with a sheepish look on my face. What do you think? I tell my Dad not to distract us and get
            distracted myself? ‘So, Fortune. And speaking of him, where’s he?’ As if on cue, Fortune landed gently next
            to us. ‘I found her house, easy. She’s weaponized it. That’s the problem right here. We can probably get
            through them in our goddy avatars, but it wouldn’t be as easy as-’
            <br><br>

            ‘“-Bringing Chaos to solve the problem for us.”’ My dad completed Fortune’s sentence for him and grinned.
            ‘So off to Chaos, isn’t it? What are we waiting for?’ Saying this, he and Fortune soared into the air. It
            was a solid hundred meters before they remembered that me and Mom couldn’t fly and came back. ‘So, who’s
            Chaos?’
            <br><br>

            ‘Your younger brother. He has a reputation for making things screw up. Whenever he’s around, machines break
            down, cars’ breaks don’t work and I always lose Game of Thrones,’ said Dad.
            <br><br>

            ‘You what, now?’
            <br><br>

            ‘Forget it.’ Mom, Fortune and I suppressed giggles. We were soaring high above Brooklyn when Dad asked,
            ‘Where’s Chaos’ place, by the way, Fortune?’
            <br><br>

            ‘Up north, Moral - He lives where the giants live so that he can wreck their evil plans.’ ‘Chaos put to good
            use.’ Then they both grinned like maniacs. And they were no better the whole way to Yukon, Canada, where
            Chaos lived.
            <br><br>

            -
            <br><br>

            It didn’t go as it was planned. Enter Alatar the Blue and Strength. As we were nearing Yukon, we met rivals
            in air. The guys were tough. Strength was, like, invulnerable. Moral would turn to fight her and run away
            screaming. She’d read our minds, and just as I’d block a backhand she’d pull my sword away.
            <br><br>

            And Alatar- the guy had mad power. He manipulated time. Like, there was this one time where I swung at him.
            Calm. He clicked a finger on his staff and just like that- everyone stopped moving, but we could see. He
            skipped away, shrieking, ‘Tra-La-La! I can’t hear you!’ And every time Alatar lost focus and got wounded,
            Strength would rejuvenate him.
            <br><br>

            We barely managed to escape them. And even that was not because of our bravery or anything- It was because
            when I cut of the head of Alatar, Moral kept Strength busy enough (By pouring pepper in her eyes) to ensure
            that Alatar died.
            <br><br>

            He didn’t die.
            <br><br>

            At the last second, Moral let go of Strength and we all ran for our lives. They escaped, and we all lived
            happily ever after for about twenty minutes.
            <br><br>

            Then came Atheris, Mistress of Snakes. If she had wanted to, she could have killed us and lived happily ever
            after. But nope. She didn’t, which was a surprise. She turned us away when we asked for supplies. When we
            hung around planning in her yard, she sent me a message.
            <br><br>

            Surprise, surprise, we decided to leave. Then, we had to deal with Rebel. That girl was tough prey. I was
            like, when do we get easy prey? The girl did nothing by the usual way. She was a leftie with her sword. She
            kept her hair in two space buns. She wore her shirt backwards to front. In short, she was like a teen rebel,
            and her nature suited her name perfectly. Which also meant trouble for us.
            <br><br>

            The usual ways of maiming, killing, torturing and dismembering did not work with her. Every time she dodged
            our swipes at her, she said, ‘Punks. You guys wouldn’t know Fight if she hit you in the face.’ Yeah, she
            wasn’t exactly the ‘Barbie and Ponies and Rainbows’ girl. More like the ‘Fight and Fight and Fight’ girl. We
            had a hard, hard time getting away from her. Slumping our way to Chaos’ place, we figured that we’d all rest
            a couple of days and take Chaos to help us fight Evil.

            Stretchy Symbolism!
        </h1>
        <h3>By Vedika</h3>
        <p>Rubber bands- we use them every day, yet have we even given a thought to how symbolic they are? <br><br>
            They are only looked upon as functional. So let’s take a minute here, and actually think of a rubber band.
            <br><br>
            The multi-hued, thin elastic band has in its power to serve a wide range of purposes. Whether it’s holding a
            mop of hair up, using them in the kitchen to close pouches of snacks, they always come in handy.
            But my moment of epiphany came when I realised the hardy stretch mate, has a lot of life lessons to offer.
            <br><br>
            Like a rubber band, we should be able to stretch and challenge ourselves as much as we can, and bounce back
            every time. Sure they wear out but humans do too. The effort matters. Here are a few incredible things I
            noticed about rubber bands. <br><br>
            Acting from personal power: <br><br> Like a rubber band, we need to act from our own power, take control of
            our situation and hold ourselves together. We need to take action, but first we must forget all our fears.
            <br><br>Always stretching and challenging ourselves: <br><br>We should always strive to be the best versions
            of ourselves, and always push ourselves to achieve our goals. It is essential to grow and develop at every
            stage. The first step should be out of our comfort zone, and then further on to realizing what we’re
            actually capable of. It’s not our ability or inability, as the case may be, that holds us back, but the
            fears in our mind. But we should be realistic and know our limits. If we push too hard we may snap from the
            amount of pressure.
            <br><br>Knowing our purpose: <br><br>No one is ever insignificant or useless. If we’ve learnt anything from
            rubber bands it’s that we always have a purpose no matter how small it is. Once we set a goal or a target
            we, we have a better motivation to see things clearly, so we can push ahead past the adversities. Knowing
            your purpose will drive you to do better in life.
            <br><br> Having good reflexes: <br><br>Ever noticed how when we stretch a rubber band and let go, it
            immediately snaps back into shape? We should too. We need to think and act fast. Nothing should ever be able
            to break us, as we bounce back each time quicker than before. Having good reflexes helps with sports and
            most definitely requires practice. They also help keep us safer. If we have fast reflexes we’ll be able to
            avoid risky situations, whether physical or mental.
            <br><br>
            Accepting ourselves: <br><br>Rubber bands, like humans, come in all different shapes, colours and sizes and
            can be fashionable and blingy or just plain and simple to fit in with the circumstance. They too have
            different names and different uses- for example, a hair tie is used to hold our hair up, and elastic bands
            are used to grip hold things together. There is no place for superiority complex because every variety is
            useful in its own way. What we need to understand is that no matter what anyone says we’ll always be strong
            enough to believe in ourselves & stretch past demotivating words and achieve our goals.
            <br><br>Taking responsibility: <br><br>Like rubber bands do, we must help out wherever we can. Everything
            that happens in our life is a result of our actions whether they’re physical or mental. If we ever encounter
            a problem, no one else will be able to solve it but ourselves. We take responsibility once we accept our
            thoughts that are coming from our mind. The words we speak should come from within is and the actions we do
            should be our own.

        <h3>By Aravind</h3>
        <p>
            1) The more you take, the more you leave behind. What am I? <br><br>
            2) An 8-letter word can have a letter taken away and it still makes a word. Take another letter away and it
            still makes a word. Keep on doing that until you have one letter left. What is the word? <br><br>
            3) A boy was at a carnival and went to a booth where a man said to the boy, "If I write your exact weight on
            this piece of paper then you have to give me $50, but if I cannot, I will pay you $50." The boy looked
            around and saw no scale so he agrees, thinking no matter what the carny writes he'll just say he weighs more
            or less. In the end the boy ended up paying the man $50. How did the man win the bet? <br><br>
            4) A woman shoots her husband. Then she holds him underwater for over 5 minutes. Finally, she hangs him. But
            5 minutes later they both go out together and enjoy a wonderful dinner together. How can this be? <br><br>
            5) How do you spell COW in thirteen letters? <br><br>
            6) How many times can you subtract the number 5 from 25? <br><br>
            7) Ralph is a very controlling person who totally dominates his partner, Sam. When Sam is in Ralph’s
            presence, Sam is never allowed to speak, eat, or drink anything. Perhaps this is because Ralph is 6 feet six
            inches tall, and Sam, being less than 5 feet tall, is intimidated by Ralph’s stature. Whatever the cause,
            most people hearing these facts would think this situation is nearly criminal; but not Sam. In fact, there
            are certain times when Ralph gives him permission, that Sam speaks some very sarcastic words right to
            Ralph’s face, and sometimes even verbally abuses Ralph. In retaliation, Ralph once again silences Sam,
            deciding when and if Sam should ever be allowed to speak. Ralph, when in the presence of others with Sam,
            appears to put on a good front by putting his hand on Sam’s back, hoping to show his friendship and concern
            for Sam. Why hasn’t anyone called DCFS on behalf of poor Sam, and what about Sam’s right to free speech? or
            are things not quite what they appear to be? Just what is going on here? <br><br>
            (dad riddles ahead) <br><br>
            8) We all know 6 is scared of 7 because 789. But why <i>did</i> 7 eat 9? <br><br>
            9) While Sam was traveling, he saw a lake, a tree, and a city. What did he see? <br><br>
            10) What weighs more? A pound of feathers or a pound of stones? <br><br>
            11) What did the pirate say on his 80th birthday? <br><br>
            12) How many seconds are there in a year? <br><br>
            13) Who is bigger? Mr Bigger, Mrs Bigger, or their baby? <br><br>
            14) What do you call an alligator who regularly wears vests? <br><br>
            15) What do you call a hippie’s wife?

        <h3>Clutches </h3>
        <p>Held, not tenderly, <br>But tight; an inescapable cage <br>In which life and death dwell, side by side. <br>A
            cycle, a circle. <br>Spun like an intricate web of lies, <br>We are caught in clutches. <br>Clutches, that
            slowly drag us down.

            Isn't that the essence,<br>

            Will life be as interesting,<br>
            If it was up and up all the way?
            <br><br>
            Ups and downs,<br>
            Smiles and frowns,<br>
            Tears of joy,<br>

            Why only me?<br>

            Did you question?<br>

            The hottie in school,<br>

        <p>Life is weird,<br>

            keep away from your phones,<br>

            will I grow up to be,<br>
            Brother, Father and Grandfather?<br>
            And call my son, silly?<br>

        <h3>A second chance</h3>

        <p>The girl in glasses,<br>
            with clips in her teeth,<br>
            Had a heart of gold,<br>
            Ready to mould,
            <br><br>
            Waited for a glance,<br>
            Stuck in a weird trance,<br>
            All she wanted was him,<br>
            But he was behind looks,
            <br><br>
            She cried and cried,<br>
            Untill one fine day,<br>
            She decided to focus,<br>
            On goals and self love,
            <br><br>
            Years passed by,<br>
            When by accident,<br>
            Bumped into him,<br>
            Looking at her with awe,
            <br><br>
            Do i know you,<br>
            He asked,<br>
            They spoke,<br>
            Sparks did fly,
            <br><br>
            But this time,<br>
            Only the tables had turned,<br>
            For attention he yearned,<br>
            She sweetly said no,
            <br><br>
            For she had grown,<br>
            In beauty and in brains,<br>
            Things had fallen into place,<br>
            Now in her happy place,
            <br><br>
            The pretty girl from school,
            Still looked the same,
            Still in the love game,
            But she didn't want him,
            <br><br>
            Sometimes,
            Life gives second chances,
            Just so you know,
            You can say no,
            <br><br>
            And proudly say,
            "i'm worth much more"

        <h3>On that Winter</h3>

        <p>
            Before that winter, a furnace roared.<br>
            It burns so deep, scathing.<br>
            Rolling flames, grazing;<br>
            A warmth that I adored.
            <br><br>

            Unbeknownst, a bitter wind crept<br>
            Masking daggers of jagged ice<br>
            passing through the weakened furnace to slice<br>
            And smother it, as it went.
            <br><br>

            And after, when a shadow of a flame remained,<br>
            The raging fire now stark,<br>
            It flickered in the silent dark;<br>
            A light so faint, It strained.<br>
            <br><br>
            The once golden heart of wood did splinter<br>
            Broken sculpture to behold.<br>
            Now blanketed in frost and cold;
            <br><br>

            I lost my warmth that winter.

            And set every feeling of mine on fire,<br><br>

            My veins have been charred,<br>
            And from living I have been barred,<br><br>

            This world of mine has turned sullen blue,<br>
            I don't how long it will be before you catch the flu<br><br>

            A speck of light pierces through the scar,<br>

        <h3>By Paddy</h3>
        <p>
            I wrote something on the wall when I was like 4 years old and now everytime I look at it I get mini
            flashbacks to when I was younger. <br>
            <br> Traffic lights are dumb. They’re a great thing that help avoid accidents and stuff but the 2 most
            important colours had to be red and green, even though they’re the colours with the highest wave length or
            something scientific like that, they’re also the colours most people are colour blind to. <br><br> Nature is
            lazy. It always manages to get away with doing the bare minimum. I mean, think about it. Bubbles are
            spherical in shape, conveniently they’re the shape with the least surface area, and when 2 bubbles meet,
            they share a common wall lessening the amount of materials used. Coincidence? I think not. <br><br> What if
            instead of humans growing plants, they’re the ones growing us. What if they’re actually so much more
            intelligent than we thought they were, what if they give us oxygen just so that they can have carbon
            dioxide- what if they only tolerate us so that when we go extinct they use our bodies as fertilizer? I mean,
            technically compost is just other dead plants. So it’s like they’re thriving off their own dead relatives?
            <br><br> Electric signals of mushrooms actually sound really cool, I need to get myself a playlist full of
            them. They kinda sound like something aliens would be vibing to- <br><br> Beds don’t need to be elevated,
            they don’t need to have legs. They could just be on the floor. Random. <br><br> Ever look at something until
            it looks creepy or ugly and then wonder how it went from looking fine to looking weird? <br><br> What if
            doors and windows are portals to a shared outside world, what if the construction workers were secretly
            elves and fairies with pixie dust- or maybe they use blocks of magic? <br><br> Covid tests infront of movies
            and shows never say if the people tested negative, they just say they got tested for the virus. Suspicious.
            <br><br> For some reason I’ve noticed people yawn whenever we’re talking about yawns- shoot it happened
            again. I’m yawning as I type this. <br><br> Unicorns are basically horses with horns but giraffes are long
            necked herbivorous leopards. You tell me which one is more believable. <br><br>
            Gold fish is a really lazy name for a gold fish. It’s like naming Zebras striped horses or flamingos pink
            birds. Speaking of flamingos, apparently they only turn pink when they eat shrimp which is pink? I wonder
            what colour I would be if I turned the colour of the food I ate.(note from Anhiti: TRANSPARENT. EAT MORE
            FOOD PADDY) <br><br> Does anyone else forget everything they learnt the moment a test in finished? What even
            is the point of tests if we forget everything right after? Is it supposed to measure your ability in
            memorizing or what you learnt? I’m genuinely curious, if you’re an adult how much do you remember from
            school?

        <h1 style="color:#a7cdbd; text-shadow:2px 2px #bbe1c3; ">The Chernobyl Catastrophe</h1>
        <h3>By Aadhav</h3>
        <p>
            This dates back many years ago, in Pripyat (present day Ukraine);
            when a nuclear reactor in sector 4 exploded, causing large amounts of radioactive material
            such as Uranium to be hurled into the atmosphere. If you might not have guessed,
            this article is about Chernobyl or specifically the Chernobyl nuclear accident.
            This took place on April 26th 1986 when Uranium was launched into the sky due to reactor design flaws,
            serious breach in protocol and inexperienced group of team members.
            The explosion triggered a large fireball that destroyed the entire reactor and the entire power unit.
            The Soviet Union tried to cover the incident up and make excuses, however Sweden brought it forward.
            Immediately they started evacuations and over 3 lakhs of people were transported to different cities, across
            the globe.
            Though a few of the people near that explosion developed thyroid cancer, many survived it and are healthy
            today.
            A vast number of factors were affected due to the explosion.
            For example, the precipitation of countries such as England and Norway were greatly affected and severely
            decreased.
            The forests around a four square mile radius absorbed the radiation and died turning reddish brown hence the
            forests were called Red Forests.
            The lands barren and fields unfit for cultivating. Shards of glass and debris we strewn all over the place.
            <br><br>
            However there is more to the tale and positives to take away.
            Seventy Percent of the trees have grown back and the forests have been able reach their fullest.
            By clearing out the humans, Chernobyl has been able to retrieve all vanished unrecalled wildlife and
            leopard, foxes and the once extinct Przewalski’s horse are found in abundance.
            Chernobyl now holds the largest wolves population and Timberwolves thrive here as the tertiary predator of
            the food chain.
            Even by destroying the forests they have been able to grow back and various ecosystems exist now.
            This disaster has another fallout; it hastened the end of the Soviet Union which led to formation of
            different countries.
            Due to the barbarous side effects of this accident there was an anti-nuclear movement led by various
            different countries.
            <br><br>
            Today, Chernobyl beckons to tourists who are intrigued by its history and its hazards.

        <h3>By Aravind</h3>
        <p>“Oh, hi there Adam. Guess what happened today? I found my power!
            <br><br>
            Amethius told me that summoning nature is limited to power you get. If you’re lucky, you get to summon
            useful things, unlike that poor ’64 guy, who could only summon chia seeds and a few fruits. Well, if we ever
            have a food shortage, at least he could help!
            <br><br>
            Anyway, I got the power to summon healing herbs. Cool, right? But it took so long to find out; I had to try
            summoning so many plants, I barely summoned 2 different herbs. Amethius told that next training time, we
            would find more plants I can summon. He also told me that each of us have a spirit colour that’s associated
            with your power, even you! It’s so cool that when I summon the herbs, neon green light flashes! Amethius
            told me that green was my spirit colour. Additionally, us Nature peeps also can summon an animal as part of
            our power, but I haven’t found mine yet. I hope I get something cute like a puppy!”
            <br><br>
            He made me so jealous, but Leo also made me wonder about my power and spirit colour. I met Amber who told me
            about herself.
            <br><br>
            “Hey, Adam! How’s it going?”
            <br><br>
            “It’s going pretty great! I never thought gods existed, or I would be important to people in any way, yet
            here I am!”
            <br><br>
            “Great! Did you find your power and spirit colour yet?”
            <br><br>

            “No, but Leo found both. It makes me wonder a lot about them.”
            <br><br>


            “It’s alright. In fact, there are a few people who have been searching for years and still haven’t found out
            yet.”
            <br><br>

            “Hey, I never asked, how was your life… before this?”
            <br><br>

            “Before? I barely had a ‘before’. I used to have normal parents, just like you- “
            <br><br>

            “Used to?”
            <br><br>

            “LET ME FINISH, PLEASE! Ugh, no wonder Arbeal got irritated!
            <br><br>

            Anyway, I was just about 11 months old when both of them passed away in a ship accident. At that time Reylia
            was just somewhere nearby looking for the three 13-year-olds back then when she noticed the accident. She
            took all 3 of us to the nearest hospital, but she had to go a long way since we were on the Earth-Mars
            highway. By the time she got there, Mom and Dad passed away, but I hadn’t suffered any major injuries, so I
            survived. Reylia tracked the address written on Dad and Mom’s wallets and found out about me through my
            birth certificate that I was around 11 months old that time, and my name was Amber Grace. Reylia also
            noticed that I had a crescent-shaped scar on my left shoulder. She felt sorry for me, so she took me into
            The Second Earth and took care of me, and so did Arbeal and Amethius, I chose to go with Reylia when I was
            around seven, and so she trained me and taught me all there is to know about The Second Earth.”
            <br><br>

            “Oh. I’m so sorry.”
            <br><br>

            “Yeah, whatever, that was almost 12 years ago. It’s time for the next training period. Let’s go! This one,
            it’s all of us.”
            <br><br>

            “Okay!”
            <br><br>

            And so we went outside, where we all gathered.

        <h1 style="color:#a7cdbd; text-shadow:2px 2px #bbe1c3; ">Optimism or Pessimism?</h1>
        <h3>Anonymous</h3>
        <p>
            We tend to overestimate the probability of positive events happening in the future while grossly
            underestimating the probability of negative ones. Chances are when you imagine your future it is usually
            better than your current situation.
            <br><br>
            Pessimists are better equipped for dealing with stress and therefore perform better. Setting low
            expectations reduces the pressure to be perfect and encourages pessimists to think through all the possible
            pitfalls and thus be better prepared for setbacks.
            <br><br>
            Studies show that optimism gives you a better outlook on life, better resources for coping, and better
            problem-solving abilities. However, excessive optimism can lead people to overestimate the likelihood that
            they can experience good things while avoiding bad things. The optimism bias suggests that people often
            underestimate their risk of experiencing negative outcomes, and when people are overly optimistic about
            something, they may be less likely to think about all of the potential risks and take steps to mitigate
            those issues. Which could ultimately make it more likely that their efforts fail, or at least run into major
            problems along the way.
            <br><br>
            To be entirely optimistic about the rules always working in our favour would be stupid, but to be
            pessimistic about the game as a whole just because the rules don't always work in our favour would be
            equally as stupid. What game is a game at all where the rules always work out in the player's favour? To
            give up on life entirely would be like throwing out a game because we sometimes lose as if the game would be
            worth playing if we knew we would win every time.
            <br><br>
            Ultimately, the best approach is probably to be pessimistic about life's conditions in order to face their
            realities and be optimistic in our abilities to face the realities to form meaning and experience through
            them. Rather than being optimistic about the possibility of finding ideas that will rid ourselves and our
            lives of disorder and confusion, maybe we should attempt to be optimistic about the potential value found in
            accepting and enduring it.
